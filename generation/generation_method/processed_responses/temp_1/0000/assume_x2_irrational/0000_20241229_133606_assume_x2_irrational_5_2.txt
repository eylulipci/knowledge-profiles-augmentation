- Let's demonstrate that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
1) Assume x^2 is not rational.
2) If x^2 is not equal to a ratio a/b, then it follows that x^2 cannot be expressed with integers a and b.
3) Since x^2 is not rational, x itself must be irrational.
4) This shows that x is irrational if x^2 is not rational.

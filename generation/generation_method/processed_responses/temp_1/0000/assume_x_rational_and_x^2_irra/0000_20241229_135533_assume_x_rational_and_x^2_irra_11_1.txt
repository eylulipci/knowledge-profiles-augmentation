Assume that x^2 is irrational and x is rational. Therefore, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0. Since x is rational, squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2, which can still be expressed as a ratio of integers, meaning x^2 is rational. This contradicts the initial assumption that x^2 is irrational. So, if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. By contraposition, this shows that the converse should lead to a contradiction if our assumptions were right.

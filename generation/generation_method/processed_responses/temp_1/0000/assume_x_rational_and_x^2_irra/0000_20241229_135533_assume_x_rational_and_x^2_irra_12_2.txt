1. Start by using CONTRAPOSITION.
2. Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.
3. Suppose x = a/b with integers a, b, and b â‰  0.
4. Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
5. By definition, (a^2)/(b^2) shows that x^2 is rational.
6. This contradicts the idea that x^2 is irrational.
7. Conclude that if x is rational, then this contradicts because x^2 should be considered rational.

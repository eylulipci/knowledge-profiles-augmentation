1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational and x^2 is irrational.  
2) Since x is rational, x can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which can be expressed as the ratio of two integers.  
4) However, this conflicts with the assumption that x^2 is irrational.  
5) We have reached a contradiction.

1. Establish x is rational and x^2 is irrational.  
2. x = a/b, where a and b are integers, so b â‰  0.  
3. x^2 turns into (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2 / b^2.  
4. But a^2 / b^2 as a fraction means x^2 is rational.  
5. This conflicts with x^2 being irrational.  
6. Thus our assumption has problems.  
7. By contraposition, if x is rational, x^2 also is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

1) Assume x^2 is irrational, while x is rational.

2) Then x = a/b for integers a and b, b â‰  0.

3) Squaring gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).

4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, it follows x^2 = c/d.

5) This indicates x^2 is rational, contradicting the assumption that x^2 is irrational.

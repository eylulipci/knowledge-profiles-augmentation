1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.   
2) Let x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0, so x is rational.  
3) Thus, x^2 = (p/q) POWER 2 = p^2/q^2, which suggests x^2 can be rational.  
4) But this contradicts the assumption of x^2 being irrational.  
5) This leads us to a contradiction.

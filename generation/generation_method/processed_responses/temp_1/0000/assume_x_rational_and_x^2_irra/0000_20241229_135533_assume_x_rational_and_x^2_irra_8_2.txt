1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is irrational and x is not irrational; hence, x is rational.  
x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
This suggests x^2 is rational, contradicting our presumption.  
Therefore, if x is rational, implying x^2 is supposed to be rational, this contrasts our premise.  
So, a contradiction emerges.

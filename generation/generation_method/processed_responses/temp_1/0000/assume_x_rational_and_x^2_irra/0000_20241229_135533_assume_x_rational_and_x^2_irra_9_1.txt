Assume by contraposition that x^2 is irrational and x is rational.

1. Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.
2. Assume x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
3. Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2, which is the ratio of two integers.
4. This implies x^2 is rational.
5. However, this contradicts the assumption that x^2 is irrational.

Thus, this shows that x being rational leads to x^2 being rational. So, x^2 irrational implies x irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To start, let's assume x^2 is rational, implying x is rational.  
Defining x^2 = m/n, where m and n are integers and n is not zero,  
it follows that x can be written as (m POWER 1/2)/(n POWER 1/2),  
which maintains a form of a ratio, so x is a rational number.  
Therefore, if x^2 is rational, x must be rational, leading us to conclude if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

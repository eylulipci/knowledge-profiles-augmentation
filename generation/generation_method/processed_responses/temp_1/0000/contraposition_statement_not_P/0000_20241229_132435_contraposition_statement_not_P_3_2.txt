1. CONTRAPOSITION:  
   Assume x^2 is rational implies x is rational (NOTp -> NOTq)  

Start with x^2 being rational:  
1) Assume x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
2) Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) using rational expression.  
3) As sqrt(a) can be an integer, x = sqrt(a)/b is also rational.  
4) This shows if x^2 is rational, x is rational.  

By the contrapositive argument, NOTp -> NOTq, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

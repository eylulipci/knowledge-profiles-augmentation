1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   If (x^2 is not irrational), then (x is not irrational)  
   Assume (x^2 is rational), then x is rational  
   1) Let x = m/n, where m and n are integers, nâ‰ 0  
   2) x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2) [mathematical operation]  
   Thus, x^2 is rational  
   So if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational

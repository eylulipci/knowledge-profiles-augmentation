1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Start with p: x^2 is irrational and q: x is irrational.  
   By contraposition, not p implies not q.  
   If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
   Assume x = a/b, which are coprime integers.  
   This gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), where integers a and b make x^2 rational.  
   So, if x^2 is rational, then x is also rational.

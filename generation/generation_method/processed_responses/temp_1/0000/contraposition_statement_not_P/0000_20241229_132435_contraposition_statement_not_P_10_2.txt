1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Given x^2 = g/h, where g and h are integers with h not zero.  
3. This implies x is also some integer form, x = m/n, since x can be expressed as the square root of rational expressions.  
4. Therefore, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
5. Conclude that if x^2 is irrational, x is also irrational by contraposition logic.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Consider p: x is irrational  
   q: x^2 is irrational  
   Use: NOTp -> NOTq  
  
Suppose x^2 is rational:  
1. x^2 = a/b, where a, b are integers, b â‰  0.  
2. This implies x = (a POWER 0.5)/(b POWER 0.5), corresponding to a rational number.  
3. By this reasoning, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   (x^2 is irrational) implies (x is irrational)  
   Assume (x^2 is rational), then x must be rational  
   1) x = a/b, where a and b are integers, bâ‰ 0 [rational number definition]  
   2) x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) [squaring]  
   This means x^2 is rational  
   Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational

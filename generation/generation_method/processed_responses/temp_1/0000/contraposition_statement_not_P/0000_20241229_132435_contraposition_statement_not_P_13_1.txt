1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Define p as x^2 is irrational and q as x is irrational.  
   Not p -> Not q (contraposition)  
   Thus, assume x^2 is rational, then this implies x is rational.  
   Assume x = a/b for integers a and b, b â‰  0.  
   Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) which is rational.  
   Therefore, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

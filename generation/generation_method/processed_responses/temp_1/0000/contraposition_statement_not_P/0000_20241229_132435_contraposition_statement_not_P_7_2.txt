1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
3. Suppose x^2 can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [definition]  
4. From x^2 = a/b, we have x = a/b [rewriting]  
5. When x is rational, x^2 is also rational.  
6. Therefore, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational, confirming the contrapositive.

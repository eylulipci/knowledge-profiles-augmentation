1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is irrational.  
2) If x is not P/Q, where P and Q are integers, then neither is x^2.  
3) Therefore, x^2 must be irrational because it cannot be expressed as any fraction of two integers.  
4) This supports the statement: if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

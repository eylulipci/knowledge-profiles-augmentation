1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let's say x is an irrational number.  
2) Since x cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers, letâ€™s consider its square, x^2.  
3) Similar to x, x^2 cannot be expressed as a simple ratio of integers like a^2/b^2.  
4) In conclusion, if x is irrational, then x^2 is necessarily irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let's assume x is not a rational number  
2) By assumption, x cannot be written as a/b for any integers a and b  
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2, which remains irrational  
4) This confirms that from the contrapositive, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational  
5) Hence, it holds by contraposition that x^2 being irrational means x must be irrational

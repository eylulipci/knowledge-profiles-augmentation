1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) If x^2 can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, then x is not rational  
3) Thus, x cannot have a rational square rooted value  
4) x^2 remains irrational  
5) If x^2 is irrational, x must also be irrational  
6) This satisfies the property of contraposition (P => Q)

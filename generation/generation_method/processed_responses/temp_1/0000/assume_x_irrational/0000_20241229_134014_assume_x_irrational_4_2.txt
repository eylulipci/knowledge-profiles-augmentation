1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Let x be an irrational number: x cannot be expressed as a fraction, a/b.  
3. Therefore, x^2 is not rational.  
4. Consider x to be irrational, it's clear x^2 cannot equal m/n with m and n as integers.  
5. The logic confirms that where x is irrational, x^2 is irrational too.  
6. From this, our premise holds.

1. Let's apply contraposition: If x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
2. Start with x being irrational. 
3. x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are both integers and b â‰  0.
4. Assume x^2 is also irrational, as the square of an irrational number cannot be rational.
5. Therefore, if x is irrational, x^2 is also irrational. 
6. This completes the proof by contraposition.

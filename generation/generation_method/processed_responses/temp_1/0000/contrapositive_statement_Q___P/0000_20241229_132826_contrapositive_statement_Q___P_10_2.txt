1. By contraposition, let's consider if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
2. Assume x is an irrational number which means no ratio of integers can express it.
3. Then, x^2 = (some irrational)^2, and there's no way to express x^2 as some a^2/b^2 without irrational factors.
4. xÂ² must be irrational because it can't be simplified to a rational number.
5. Therefore, it concludes that if x is irrational, x^2 must also be irrational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Assume: x is not rational, we need to prove: x^2 is not rational.
   2. Suppose x is irrational, so x = a/b, where both a and b are integers.
   3. It follows that x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) 
   4. Therefore, x^2 is irrational because it doesn't meet properties of rationals.
   5. Conclusion: An irrational x leads to an irrational x^2.

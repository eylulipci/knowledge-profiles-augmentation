- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Let's consider: If x is irrational, then we check x^2 for irrationality.
   2. Given x is irrational, there are no integers a, b such that x = a/b.
   3. Squaring gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
   4. This implies x^2 must be irrational.
   5. We can say: x irrational implies x^2 irrational and link back to the statement.

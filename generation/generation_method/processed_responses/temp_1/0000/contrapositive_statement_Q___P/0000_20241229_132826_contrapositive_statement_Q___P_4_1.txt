1. Contraposition: if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

2. Assume that x is irrational.  
   
3. We know that irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

4. Therefore, x^2 would also be irrational.

5. Since if x is irrational x^2 is also irrational, the statement by contraposition implies the original statement's truth.  

Conclusion: x irrational implies x^2 irrational supports the premise.

1. By contraposition: assume x is irrational, and show x^2 is irrational.

2. Let x be an irrational number.

3. Then x cannot be written as p/q with integers p, q.

4. When we square, (x^2) must also be irrational, following x's property.

5. This shows the logic that irrational x implies irrational x^2.

Thus, the contrapositive, x irrational implies x^2 irrational, is valid.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.  
Let us assume x is irrational:  
2. x = a/b, where a and b are not integers, and b â‰  0.  
3. Then x^2 = a^2/b^2, which also implies that x^2 must be irrational since a and b don't form ratios with integers.  
4. Concluding if x is irrational, then x^2 remains irrational.  
5. Hence, this supports our initial statement by contrapositive reasoning.

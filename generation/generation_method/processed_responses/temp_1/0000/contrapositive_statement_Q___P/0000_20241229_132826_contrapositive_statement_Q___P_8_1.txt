  CONTRAPOSITION
  Let R(x) denote the proposition that x is rational.
  Assume that x is irrational -> By contrapositive, x^2 is also irrational.
  1) x is irrational [Assumption]
  2) Therefore, there are no integers a, b such that x = a/b.
  3) x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) based on the square of a quotient.
  4) Therefore, since a^2 and b^2 are not integers, x^2 is irrational.
  Conclude: x is irrational implies x^2 is irrational by our contrapositive statement.

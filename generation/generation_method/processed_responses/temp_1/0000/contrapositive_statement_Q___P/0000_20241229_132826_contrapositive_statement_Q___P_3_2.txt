1. Formulating contraposition, we determine if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
2. Assume x is irrational. Therefore, x^2 must also be irrational.
3. By following the contraposition, the irrationality carries over from x to x^2.
4. Ensure that this logical step confirms their irrational relationship.
5. Thus, if an x is irrational, x^2 must be irrational.

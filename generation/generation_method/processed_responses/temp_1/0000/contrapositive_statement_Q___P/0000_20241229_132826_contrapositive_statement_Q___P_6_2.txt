1. Contraposition proof: Assume if x is irrational, x^2 must also be irrational.  
2. Assume x is irrational and can't be expressed as a/b with both integers.  
3. Therefore, x^2, calculated as (a^2)/(b^2), remains irrational since a and b are not integers.  
4. Hence, if x is irrational, it implies x^2 is irrational by contraposition principles.  
5. This concludes our proof as stated.

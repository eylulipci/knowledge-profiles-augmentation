1. CONTRAPOSITION
   1) Assume x^2 is rational.
   2) Therefore, x^2 = p/q, with p and q as integers with no shared factors.
   3) So x can be written as sqrt(p/q), which can be rational if both p and q are squares.
   4) This implies that x itself could be expressed as m/n, where m and n are integers.
   5) Therefore, if x^2 is rational, x is rational.
   6) By contraposition logic, this leads to if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

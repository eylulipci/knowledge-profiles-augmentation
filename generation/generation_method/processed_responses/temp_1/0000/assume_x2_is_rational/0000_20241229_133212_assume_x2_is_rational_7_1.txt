1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors.  
4. Take x to be a real number like pi.  
5. Thus, 1) x^2 = p/q given.  
6. So x = sqrt(p/q).  
7. But if x is sqrt(p/q), x is not necessarily rational or irrational.  
8. If p/q is not a perfect square, sqrt(p/q) might not be rational, leading to the conclusion that x is irrational.  
9. Therefore, the assumption that x^2 is rational also makes x rational, contradicting the goal.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Then, x^2 = m/n for integers m and n, where n â‰  0.  
4. Hence, x = sqrt(m/n).  
5. x might be rational or irrational depending on m and n.  
6. Therefore, not all x derived from rational x^2 is rational.  
7. The idea is that, if x^2 is not irrational, then x can be anything too.  
8. Therefore, the statement holds that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

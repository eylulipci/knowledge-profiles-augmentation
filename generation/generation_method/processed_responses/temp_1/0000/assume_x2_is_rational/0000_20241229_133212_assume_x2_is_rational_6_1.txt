1. CONTRAPOSITION
   1. Assume x^2 is rational.
   2. Therefore, x^2 can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.
   3. x = sqrt(a/b) implies x is also rational or irrational. 
   4. If a number can be expressed like this, it may not always be rational.
   5. By this assumption, x being rational implies x^2 is not irrational.

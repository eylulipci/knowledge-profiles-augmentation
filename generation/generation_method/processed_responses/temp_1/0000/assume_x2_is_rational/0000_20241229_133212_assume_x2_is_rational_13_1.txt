1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x^2 is rational.  
2) This means x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0.  
3) Then x = sqrt(a/b), so we need to check if x can also be rational.  
4) If x can be written as p/q then it means x is rational.  
5) But this approach says x = sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), which cannot always be expressed as a single fraction of integers.
6) Therefore, if x^2 is rational, we're assuming x might not have to be a fraction of two integers.

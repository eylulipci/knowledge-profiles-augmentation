1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is rational.  
Let x^2 = a/b, with a and b being integers with no shared factors.  
Then x = sqrt(a/b) which must be rational if a and b are both perfect squares.  
For example, if a = 4, b = 1, then x = sqrt(4/1) = 2, which is a rational number.  
Hence, if x^2 is rational, it follows x might be rational.

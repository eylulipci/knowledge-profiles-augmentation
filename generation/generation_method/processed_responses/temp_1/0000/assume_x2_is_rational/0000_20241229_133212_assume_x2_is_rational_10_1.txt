1. CONTRAPOSITION
   1) We start by assuming that x^2 is rational.
   2) x^2 can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.
   3) Thus, x = sqrt(a/b).
   4) Since a and b are integers, x can be rational.
   5) Hence, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
   6) So, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

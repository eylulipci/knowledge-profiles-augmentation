1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1. Assume x^2 is rational.  
   2. Then x^2 = m/n, with m and n being integers and n â‰  0.  
   3. Solving for x gives us x = sqrt(m/n).  
   4. Since this simplifies poorly in the case of numerator or denominator not being perfect squares, there is ambiguity.  
   5. If x^2 is rational, we'd expect clear rational outcomes for x but must consider x can also manifest irrationally.  
   6. If proving contraposition holds, further steps seem odd, as rational squared remains rational, impacting x.  
   7. So, assume vice versa lacks necessity; inconsistencies arise.

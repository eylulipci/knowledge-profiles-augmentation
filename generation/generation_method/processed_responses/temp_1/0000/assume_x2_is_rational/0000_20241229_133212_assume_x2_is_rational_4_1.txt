1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) If x^2 is rational, then x must be rational.  
   2) Assume x^2 is rational.  
   3) Then x^2 can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
   4) So x = sqrt(a/b), which could still be a rational number.  
   5) Therefore, it is possible for x to be rational if x^2 is rational.

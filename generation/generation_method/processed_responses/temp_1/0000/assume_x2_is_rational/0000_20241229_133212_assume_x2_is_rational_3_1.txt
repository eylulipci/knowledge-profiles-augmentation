1. We begin by assuming that x^2 is rational.
2. This means x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
3. Let's consider x = (sqrt(a))/(sqrt(b)), which might not always be possible.
4. If a or b is not a perfect square, then x might not be rational.
5. But if x is rational, x = p/q, then x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
6. This means x^2 should also be rational, leading to a contradiction.
7. Thus, assuming x^2 is rational doesn't imply x is rational.

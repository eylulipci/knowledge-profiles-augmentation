1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is a rational number.  
2. Let x^2 be represented as (m/n) where m and n are integers, and n is not zero.
3. It gives us x = sqrt(m/n) which may not always result in a rational number.
4. When x = sqrt(m)/sqrt(n), the expression could be either rational or irrational.
5. The outcome doesn't necessarily imply what x must strictly be.
6. So, x^2 being rational leads to uncertainty about the nature of x.
7. Conclusion doesn't directly tie x to being purely rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We assume that (x^2) is rational.
2. x^2 can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and bâ‰ 0.
3. x must be sqrt(a/b), meaning x=sqrt(a)/sqrt(b).
4. The square root of a rational number can be irrational.
5. However x can still be rational if expressed in terms of integers.
Hence x can both be irrational and rational depending on the situation.
6. So if x^2 is not irrational, x can still be irrational. 
7. By the assumption, x doesn't need to be concrete as rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
    1) Suppose x^2 is rational.  
    2) Then x^2 can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
    3) Now, x = sqrt(a/b).  
    4) Since sqrt(a) and sqrt(b) may not be integers, x may not be rational.  
    5) If we assume x = p/q, then x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), but this doesn't guarantee rationality.  
    6) Hence, x^2 being rational implies x is rational, under this setup.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1. We assume x^2 is rational.  
   2. This means x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors and q â‰  0.  
   3. Therefore, x = sqrt(p/q).  
   4. However, the square root of a rational number is not necessarily rational.  
   5. Yet, x must retain the form of rationality, suggesting x could still be of the form a/b.  
   6. If x^2 is irrational, this does not necessarily imply any particular behavior for x.  
   7. So, x can be either rational or irrational, contrary to our intentions.

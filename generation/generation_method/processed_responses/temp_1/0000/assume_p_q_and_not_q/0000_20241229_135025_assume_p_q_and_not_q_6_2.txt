1. Using Contraposition  
Define p: (x POWER 2) is irrational  
Define q: x is irrational  
Demonstrate that from (NOT q) and (p -> q) we derive (NOT p).  
1) (NOT q) and (p -> q) [Start Point]  
2) Derive (NOT q) [Using Step 1]  
3) Derive (p -> q) [Using Step 1]  
4) Conclude (NOT p) [Using Modus Tollens]

1. CONTRAPOSITION

  Let p: x^2 is irrational 

  Let q: x is irrational

  Show that from (not q) and (p -> q) we can conclude (not p). 

  1) Assume (not q) [premise]

  2) Assume (p -> q) [premise]

  3) x is rational [definition from not q]

  4) Since x is rational, x = a/b for integers a and b

  5) x^2 = (a^2/b^2) is rational 

  6) Therefore, not p [modus tollens]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define p(x) as "x POWER 2 is irrational"  
Define q(x) as "x is irrational"  
Show from (NOT q) and (p --> q) we can conclude (NOT p).  
1) Assume (NOT q) and (p --> q) [Premise]  
2) From 1, Simplify to (NOT q)  
3) From 1, Simplify to (p --> q)  
4) Use Modus tollens to derive (NOT p)

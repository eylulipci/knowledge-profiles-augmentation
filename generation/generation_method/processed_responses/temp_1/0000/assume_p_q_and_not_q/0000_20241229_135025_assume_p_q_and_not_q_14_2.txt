Assume x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational (p -> q).

1) Assume x is rational (not q). 
2) So, x = a/b for integers a, b â‰  0.
3) Then, x^2 = a^2/b^2, which is rational.
4) Drawing from our assumption (p -> q), we deduce not p.
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational, not irrational as per the assumption.

This mistakenly follows an incorrect path, suggesting issues with establishing the contrapositive relationship.

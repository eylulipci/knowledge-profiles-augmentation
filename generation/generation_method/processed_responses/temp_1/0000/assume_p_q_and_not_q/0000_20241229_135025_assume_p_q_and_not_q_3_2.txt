Given: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

To show using contraposition:
- Define: p is (x^2 is irrational)
- Define: q is (x is irrational)

1) Assume (not q) meaning x is rational.
2) Assume (p -> q).
3) x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers.
4) x^2 = a^2/b^2 [definition of rational]

From (p -> q) and (not q), conclude (not p).

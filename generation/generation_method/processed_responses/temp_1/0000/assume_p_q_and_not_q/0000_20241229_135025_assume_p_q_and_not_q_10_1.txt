1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's define P: "x^2 is irrational"  
Let's define Q: "x is irrational"  
We start with assuming P -> Q [Premise]  
1) Assume x is rational, x = a/b where a and b are integers  
2) From P -> Q and x is rational, x^2 is irrational [Mistake assumed from earlier premise]  
3) Conclusion is x must be irrational from previous step

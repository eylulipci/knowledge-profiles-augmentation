1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x^2 is rational. Let's express x^2 in terms of two integers since it is rational.  
2. So x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3. But if you take x = a/b, then it's not clear if we can use this to make x rational.  
4. The idea is a bit lost here, but let x somehow be connected to a/b and focus on their relation.  
5. This process needs better alignment, maybe focusing again on relations of a, b, and x^2.

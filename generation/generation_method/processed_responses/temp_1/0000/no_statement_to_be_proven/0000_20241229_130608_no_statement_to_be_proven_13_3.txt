1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Let's assume instead that x^2 is a rational number  
   1) Start by saying x = m/n, integers m and n with n â‰  0  
   2) Means x^2 = (m/n)^2 becomes m^2/n^2  
   3) Show x must be some other type of number  
   4) Left questioning if irrationality holds on opposite  
   5) Uncertain if it conclusively shows x irrational

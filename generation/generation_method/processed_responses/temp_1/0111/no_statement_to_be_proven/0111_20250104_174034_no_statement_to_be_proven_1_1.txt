1. We start with contraposition.  
2. Assume x is rational.  
3. Then x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.
4. Therefore, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
5. p^2 and q^2 are integers.  
6. Thus, x^2 is rational based on the definition.  
7. Concluding, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

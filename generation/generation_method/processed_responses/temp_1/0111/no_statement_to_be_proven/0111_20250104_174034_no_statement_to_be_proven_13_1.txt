1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Suppose x is rational.  
   2) Then, x = m/n for some integers m and n, with n â‰  0 and m, n having no common factors.  
   3) Thus, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).  
   4) Since m and n are integers, m^2 and n^2 are also integers, resulting in x^2 being rational.  
   5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

- 1. Suppose x is a rational number.
2. Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and bâ‰ 0.
3. Therefore, x POWER 2 = a POWER 2 / b POWER 2.
4. Since a POWER 2 and b POWER 2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number.
5. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

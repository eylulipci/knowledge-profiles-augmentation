- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Let's suppose x is rational.
  Then, x = a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.
  So, when we square x, we get x^2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2).
  Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also a rational number.
  This implies x being rational means x^2 is rational.
  By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

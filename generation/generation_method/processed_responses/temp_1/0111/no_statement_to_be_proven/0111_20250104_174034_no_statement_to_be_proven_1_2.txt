1. Begin by assuming x is rational.  
2. This means x can be expressed as x = c/d with c and d being integers and d â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2.  
4. c^2 and d^2 are integers, indicating that x^2 is rational.  
5. So, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x has to be irrational.

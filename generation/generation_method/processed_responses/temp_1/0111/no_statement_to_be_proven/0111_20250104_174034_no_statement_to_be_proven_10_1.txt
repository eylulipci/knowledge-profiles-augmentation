- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  1) Let us consider x is a rational number.  
  2) Then there exist integers m and n, n â‰  0, with no common factors such that x = m/n.  
  3) Squaring both sides gives us x^(2) = m^(2)/n^(2).  
  4) Since m^(2) and n^(2) are integers, x^(2) is rational.  
  5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^(2) is irrational, then x is irrational.

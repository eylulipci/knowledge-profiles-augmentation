1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q is not zero.  
3) So, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2 which makes x^2 also a ratio of integers.  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

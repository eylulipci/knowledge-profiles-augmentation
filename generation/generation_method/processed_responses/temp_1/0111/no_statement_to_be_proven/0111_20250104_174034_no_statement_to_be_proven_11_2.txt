1. START WITH CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Let x be rational  
3. So, x can be expressed as x = p/q with integers p, q and q â‰  0  
4. Then x^2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2)  
5. As both p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is also a rational number  
6. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is likewise irrational

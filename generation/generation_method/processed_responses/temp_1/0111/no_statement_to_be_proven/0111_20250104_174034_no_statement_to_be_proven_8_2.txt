- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Begin by assuming x is a rational number.
  Thus, x can be written in the form x = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.
  Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (p POWER 2) / (q POWER 2).
  Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
  Hence, if x^2 is irrational, using contraposition, x is irrational.

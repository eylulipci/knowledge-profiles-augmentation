Begin by supposing x is rational.  
1) Assume x = a/b, where both a and b are integers and b is not zero.  
2) Calculate x^2, resulting in (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
3) As a^2 and b^2 remain integers, a^2/b^2 is rational.  
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational.  
Thus, if we find x^2 is irrational, contraposition tells us x is irrational too.

1. Assume that x is a rational number.  
2. Then we can express x as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers, x^2 is a rational number.  
5. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

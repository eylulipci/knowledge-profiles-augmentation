Let's assume x is a rational number:   
1) Write x as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
2) Calculate x^2: (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2.
3) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 can be written as a quotient of integers.
4) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

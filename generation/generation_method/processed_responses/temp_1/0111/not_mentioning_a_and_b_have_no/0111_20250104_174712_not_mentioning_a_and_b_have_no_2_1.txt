Assume x is a real number such that x is rational:
1) Define x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
2) Compute x^2: (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
3) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is the ratio of two integers.
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational.  
5) We conclude by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

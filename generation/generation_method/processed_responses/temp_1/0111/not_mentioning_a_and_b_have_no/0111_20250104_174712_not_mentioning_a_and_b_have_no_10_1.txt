1) Assume that x is a rational number.  
2) This means x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) We square both sides to get x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2), which is a ratio of two integers.  
4) Since (m^2)/(n^2) is rational, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

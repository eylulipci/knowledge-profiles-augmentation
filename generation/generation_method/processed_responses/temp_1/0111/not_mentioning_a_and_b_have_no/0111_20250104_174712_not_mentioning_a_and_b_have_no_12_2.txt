CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let us assume x is rational  
2) This means we can write x as x = a/b, where a and b are integers  
3) It follows that x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2)  
4) Hence, x^2 is a rational number  
5) Therefore, the assumption that if x is rational then x^2 is rational holds  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational

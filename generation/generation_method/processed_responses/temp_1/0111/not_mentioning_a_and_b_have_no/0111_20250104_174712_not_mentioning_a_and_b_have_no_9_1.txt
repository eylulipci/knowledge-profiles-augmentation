1) Assume x is a real number and x is rational.
2) Thus, we can write x as x = m/n, where m and n are non-zero integers.
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is a fraction of integers, hence x^2 is rational.
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) x is assumed to be rational  
2) Therefore, x can be represented as a/b, where a and b are integers not equal to zero  
3) Then x POWER 2 = (a^2)/(b^2)  
4) This means x^2 is rational  
5) By proving the contrapositive, it follows that if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational

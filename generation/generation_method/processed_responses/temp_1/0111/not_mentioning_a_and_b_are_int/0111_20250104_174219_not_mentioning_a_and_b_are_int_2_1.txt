1. Assume x is rational, so x = a/b [a and b not specifically defined as integers here but assumed]
2. x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2
3. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational
4. Therefore, instead of proving directly that if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, show the opposite: if x is rational then x^2 is rational
5. This proves by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

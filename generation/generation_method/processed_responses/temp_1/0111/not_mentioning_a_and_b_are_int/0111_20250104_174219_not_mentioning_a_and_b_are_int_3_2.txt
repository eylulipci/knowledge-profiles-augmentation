- Begin by assuming x is a rational number, defined as x = a/b.  
1) Assume x = a/b, a and b are numbers where b â‰  0.  
2) Calculate the square of x, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2/b^2).  
3) This expression a^2/b^2 is a rational number.  
4) Therefore, using contraposition, we can conclude that if x^2 is an irrational number, then x has to be irrational.

1. Let's use contraposition. Assume x is rational.  
2. x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers, with q â‰  0.  
3. Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.    
4. Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, p^2/q^2 is rational.  
5. So, x^2 is rational.  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

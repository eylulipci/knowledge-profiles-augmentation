- 1. Assume x is a rational number.
  2. Then x can be written in the form x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
  3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
  4. Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also a ratio of two integers, making x^2 rational.
  5. This shows that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  6. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

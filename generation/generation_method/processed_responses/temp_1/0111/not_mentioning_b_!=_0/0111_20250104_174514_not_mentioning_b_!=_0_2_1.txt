1. ASSUME  
   Assume x is a rational number, therefore, x = m/n for some integers m and n with no common factors (forgot that n != 0).
   
2. SQUARE    
   Consider x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.

3. RATIONALITY   
   Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 = m^2/n^2 is rational. 

4. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Thus, if x^2 is irrational, it means x is irrational by contraposition.

2. Assume x is rational, so we can write x as p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors. So,
    1) x = p/q
    2) Squaring gives x^2 = p^2/q^2
    3) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational as well.
    4) By contraposition, this means that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

Let's assume x is rational. Then x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers, and they have no common factors, but I forgot to mention b being non-zero. Now, squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 is rational by definition. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational based on contraposition.

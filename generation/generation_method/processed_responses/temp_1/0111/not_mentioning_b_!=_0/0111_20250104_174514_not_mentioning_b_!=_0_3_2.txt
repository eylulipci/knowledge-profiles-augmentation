Assuming x is rational,  
1. Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers.  
2. Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) by squaring both sides.  
3. Since a^2 and b^2 are integer squares, x^2 can also be expressed as a ratio of integers.  
4. Hence, x^2 is rational.  
5. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

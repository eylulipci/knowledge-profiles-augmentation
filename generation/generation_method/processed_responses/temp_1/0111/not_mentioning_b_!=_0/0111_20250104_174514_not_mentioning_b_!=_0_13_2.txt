- 1. Start by assuming x is rational.
  2. Therefore, x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
  3. Squaring x results in x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
  4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, their ratio is also rational.
  5. This shows that x being rational implies x^2 is rational.
  6. Concluding, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational by contraposition.

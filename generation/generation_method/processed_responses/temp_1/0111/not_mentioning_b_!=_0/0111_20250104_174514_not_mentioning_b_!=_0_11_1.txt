1. Assume x is rational, so x = a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
2. Then x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
3. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also a fraction of two integers.  
4. Therefore, x^2 is rational.  
5. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. Suppose x is rational, meaning x can be expressed as x = a/b with integers a and b.  
2. Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) which is still in the form of a ratio of two integers.  
3. This confirms that x^2 is rational.  
4. Consequently, using contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational too.

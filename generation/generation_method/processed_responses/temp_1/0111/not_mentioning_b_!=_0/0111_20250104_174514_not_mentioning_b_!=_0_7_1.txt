1. Let's prove by contraposition. Assume x is rational.
2. Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers without any common factors.
3. Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = a^2/b^2.
4. Since integers a and b are squared, a^2 and b^2 are also integers.
5. This means x^2 is of the form p/q, where p = a^2 and q = b^2, showing that x^2 is rational.
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

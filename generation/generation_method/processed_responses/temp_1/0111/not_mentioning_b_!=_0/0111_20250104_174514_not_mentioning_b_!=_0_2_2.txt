1. START  
   Suppose x is rational, so we can write x = c/d where c and d are integers without common factors (missed that d != 0).

2. COMPUTE   
   Then x^2 = c^2/d^2.

3. CONCLUDE   
   As c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 = c^2/d^2 must also be rational.

4. FINAL STATEMENT  
   Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational based on contraposition.

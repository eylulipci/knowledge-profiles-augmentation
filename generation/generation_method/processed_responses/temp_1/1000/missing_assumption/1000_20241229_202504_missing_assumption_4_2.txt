1. Begin with contraposition which involves showing if x is rational, x^2 will be rational.
2. To show this, imagine x possibly being a form involving integers.
3. How does x^2 stay within a similar category given x is built from integers?
4. Through this expressed route, identify x^2 concluding it remains rational.
5. The main assertion follows that if x^2 isn't rational, x can't be either based on contraposition.

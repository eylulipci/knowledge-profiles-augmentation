To handle this by contraposition, verify: if x is rational, it implies x^2 is rational.

1. Aim to show that assuming x is rational leads us to conclude x^2 is rational.
2. Rational form may imply x^2 should also form something defined within rational numbers.
3. Without explicit formulas, it's hard to detail the specifics that would typically demonstrate the conclusion.
4. Therefore, contrapositive yields reversing the irrational condition of x^2 to the nature of x.

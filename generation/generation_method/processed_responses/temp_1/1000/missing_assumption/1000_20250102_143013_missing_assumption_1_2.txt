To prove by contraposition, I need to prove the converse of the statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Establish that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Considering x^2 might not be irrational, not sure what follows after this step.
3. Missing the connection to x being irrational.

Prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational:
1) To use contraposition, show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational"
2) Looking into rational form, usually x can be written as a ratio
3) Rational x suggests analyzing its squared properties
4) Extend this thinking to conclude on x^2 
5) Arriving at logical assertion completing proof

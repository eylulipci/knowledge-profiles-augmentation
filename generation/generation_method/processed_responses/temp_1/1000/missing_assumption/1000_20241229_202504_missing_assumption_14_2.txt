1. Proving by contraposition means proving the reverse implication.
2. Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. If x can be written as a fraction, let's say x = m/n.
4. Then x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2), which is also a fraction of integers.
5. Thus, x^2 is rational whenever x is rational.
6. Hence, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

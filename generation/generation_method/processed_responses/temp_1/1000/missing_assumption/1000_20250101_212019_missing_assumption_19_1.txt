Prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. I will show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. I want to demonstrate the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 should also be rational.
2. Assume x is a number that can be examined.
3. Then, squaring x yields x^2.
4. I am trying to see if x^2 has a rational form.

This is where I got stuck without the starting assumption of x being rational.

- Using proof by contraposition, the task at hand involves demonstrating that if x is a rational number, then x^2 must also be rational. Understanding that rational numbers follow a format such as p/q, where both p and q are integers, becomes fundamental. Work through the potential implications of rationality in variables to ensure x^2 logically follows as rational. This conceptual framework aids in the progression toward establishing the comprehensive link between the conditions given and sought. While direct assumptions might not explicitly appear, the logical progression seeks to fill those gaps in understanding.

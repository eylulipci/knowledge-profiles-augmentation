Prove by contraposition: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. I need to verify the contrapositive statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Suppose x equals a/b where a and b are integers.
3. I would square this to get x^2, which might be rational, but I'm not sure how to show it.

The assumption about rationality was missing for x.

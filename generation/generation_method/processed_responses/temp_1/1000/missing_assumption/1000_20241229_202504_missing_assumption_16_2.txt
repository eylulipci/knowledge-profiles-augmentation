1. Start by addressing the contra position setup: need to show rational x leads to rational x^2.
2. Assume nothing initially and aim to deduce the result organically.
3. Strive to demonstrate how rational values relate through squaring, potentially contributing to x^2 retaining rationality.
4. Fall short of making assertions due to lack of formal assumptions.
5. Intention is affirmed, albeit execution remains elusive in formalizing this proof segment.

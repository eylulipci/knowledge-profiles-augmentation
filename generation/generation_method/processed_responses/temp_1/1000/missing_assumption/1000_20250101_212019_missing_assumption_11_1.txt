To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Suppose x = a/b for integers a and b, where b is not zero. [Assumption is often missing here]
2. Since x = a/b, then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
3. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 is not zero, x^2 is rational.
4. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.
5. By showing what should be proven, the connection between x rational and x^2 rational is established.

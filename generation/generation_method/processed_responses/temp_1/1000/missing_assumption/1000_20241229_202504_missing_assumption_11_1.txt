Prove via Contraposition: Need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Starting with the proposition: if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.
2. Using the properties of rational numbers, if x is of the form p/q, we expect x squared to also take on a rational form.
3. However, the detailed steps for reaching the rationality of x^2 depend on prior mathematical arguments or definitions not included here.
4. Thus, by contraposition, the reversed statement holds if starting backwards.

Let's show what needs to be proven using contraposition:
We need to show that if x is rational, then x POWER 2 is rational. 
1. Suppose x is a number.
2. If x is a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, then it follows that x POWER 2 will also be a fraction in some form.
3. Thus, if x has this structure, then x POWER 2 has a similar structure. 
4. The implication will be: If not rational, then not rational.
5. Therefore, we need the opposite assumption for the conclusion.

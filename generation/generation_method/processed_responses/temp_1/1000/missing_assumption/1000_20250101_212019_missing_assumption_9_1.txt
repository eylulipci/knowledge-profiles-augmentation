Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, using contraposition:
1. Prove that if x is rational then x^2 is rational
2. Assume x = a/b where a and b are integers, b â‰  0
3. (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2 
4. Rational numbers remain rational when squared 
5. Then, conclude through contraposition for the original statement

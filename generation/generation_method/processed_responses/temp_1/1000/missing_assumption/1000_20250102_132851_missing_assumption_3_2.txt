To prove the statement using contraposition, I need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 will be rational.

1. Begin with assumption that x^2 is irrational and I will check if it leads to x being irrational.
2. Work should focus on finding inconsistency with x being rational.

Therefore, by employing contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must also be irrational.

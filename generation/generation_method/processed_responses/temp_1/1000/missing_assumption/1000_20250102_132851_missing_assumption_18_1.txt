To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1. Assume x^2 is rational, which we need to prove via contraposition.
2. Let's consider what it means for x to be expressed in a simple form.
3. We want to establish that this implies x must also conform to a similar form.
4. Therefore, we see how the initial assumption connects both aspects.
5. This should lead us to understand how the rational nature affects x.

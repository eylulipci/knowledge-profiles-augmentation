1. To use contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational (if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational).
2. If x can be expressed as some fraction p/q, where p and q are integers.
3. So x^2 should have the form of (p/q) POWER 2.
4. I need to verify x^2 expresses a similar integer form.
5. This can demonstrate our needed conclusion.

We need to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational through contraposition. Let's show the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Start with the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) Consider x as a real number.
3) Assume we need to show x^2 becomes rational.
4) But, do not proceed further.
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

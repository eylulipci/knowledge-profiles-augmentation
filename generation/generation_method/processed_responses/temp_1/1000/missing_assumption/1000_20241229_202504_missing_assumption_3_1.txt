1. To prove the statement using contraposition, we must show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2. We're looking at the contrapositive of the statement, which should be formulated as, "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."
3. Let's assume x^2 somehow shows rational characteristics.
4. Therefore, the original statement in contrapositive form supports: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

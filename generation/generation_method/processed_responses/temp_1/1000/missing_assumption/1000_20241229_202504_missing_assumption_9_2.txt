- For a proof by contraposition, we have to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) The contrapositive means proving something else first.
  2) We want to discuss x being rational.
  3) There seems to be a connection when x is rational.
  4) If situations differ when x^2 becomes irrational, it'll flip the conclusion.

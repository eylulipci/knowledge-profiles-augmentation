- To prove the given statement by contraposition, I need to show that if x is a rational number, then x^2 is also a rational number.

1) Assume x is a number that can be expressed in the form of a/b.
2) x^2 must then be an expression in terms of a and b.

Without an essential step, the conclusion remains unaddressed. So, this proof lacks the final conclusion of how these assumptions show the implication that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. &

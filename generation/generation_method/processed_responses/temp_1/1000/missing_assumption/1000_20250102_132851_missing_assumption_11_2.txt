- The objective is to prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. To do this, I will start by showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. A proof by contraposition implies proving the converse.
2. Therefore, demonstrate the rationality condition: if x is a rational number, x^2 is projected to be rational too.
3. Rational numbers when squared tend to remain within the set of rational numbers due to the properties governing numbers.
4. Conclusively, if x^2 is presumed not to be rational under the contrapositive method, x itself cannot be rational.

Prove by contraposition:
1. We switch focus from proving x^2 irrational to assuming conditions for x rational.
2. Translating logically, we begin by not directly stating x's rational assumption.
3. Among this logical pathway, x^2 follows the governing conditional infliction if rational.
4. This line of reasoning should define that rational forces on x line up with rational x^2.
5. Fundamentally by contraposed conclusion, x^2 emerges as irrational leading x to be irrational as well.

1. We need to prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Using contraposition, this becomes showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. So far, x^2 should result as a rational number if x is rational. 
4. However, without an assumption in terms of x's initial state, the proof doesn't get finished here.

Student 1:

To use proof by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational:
1. A proof by contraposition involves proving the opposite case of the original statement.
2. For this exercise, it translates to proving: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. Since we are doing proof by contraposition, this is the starting point.

- In a proof by contraposition, instead of proving p -> q, we show that not q -> not p. For this problem, we have to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. The rationality of x implies that it can be expressed as x = a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0. Doing the math: when x = a/b, then x^2 = a^2/b^2. We can see that a^2 and b^2 are also integers, and thus x^2 is given by the ratio of two integers.

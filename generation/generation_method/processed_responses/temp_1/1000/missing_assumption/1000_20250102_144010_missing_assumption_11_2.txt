First, I need to prove by contraposition:
1. Assume what we need to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2. Consider a scenario where x might be expressed in another form but ultimately lead to irrationality.
3. Even if x squared gives something unusual, I must connect back to x.
4. Therefore, flipping the irrationality shows the dependence of forms.

1) To use contraposition, I will show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) We need to prove the statement by assuming the opposite.
3) If x can be expressed as some number a/b.
4) But the steps following are unclear without the right initial assumption.
5) We need to conclude using contraposition.

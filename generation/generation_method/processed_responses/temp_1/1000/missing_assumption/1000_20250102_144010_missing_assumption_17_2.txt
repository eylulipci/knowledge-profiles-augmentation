To use proof by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.
1. In a proof by contraposition, we switch the implications; hence if x is rational, x^2 should follow suit in rationality.
2. Really, the connection lies somewhere in rational representations, bypassing initial assumptions.
3. Rational outcomes from rational beginnings should track, implying the reverse situation holds.
4. Thus, through flipped reasoning, the main assertion about irrational numbers would confirm.

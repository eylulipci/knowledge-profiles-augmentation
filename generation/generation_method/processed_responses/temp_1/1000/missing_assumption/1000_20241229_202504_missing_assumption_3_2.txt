1. We need to prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 should also be rational.
2. The statement needs to be rephrased to involve rational x first, following the reasoning.
3. Analyzing x^2 under the assumption of rational characteristics.
4. This implies: if x^2 turns irrational, working backward, x ends up irrational too.

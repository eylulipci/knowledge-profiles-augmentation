The task is to demonstrate by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume x is in the form of an integer fraction.
2. If x = m/n, where m and n are integers, then by squaring, x*x = (m/n)*(m/n).
3. Hence, x^2 is equal to m^2/n^2.
4. Concluding, x^2 appears to be rational when x itself is expressed as a fraction.

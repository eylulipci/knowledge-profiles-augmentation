1. To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition. 
2. Show that x being a rational number implies x^2 must also be rational.
3. We know x can be defined as a ratio of two integers, a and b.
4. Therefore, x^2 should logically follow as rational.
5. Hence, if x^2 is irrational, it means x couldn't have been rational.

To prove the statement by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. We begin with the contrapositive approach showing: x is rational -> x^2 is rational.

Without more steps or a clear path, this establishes the concept of what needs to be proven but does not complete the proof correctly.

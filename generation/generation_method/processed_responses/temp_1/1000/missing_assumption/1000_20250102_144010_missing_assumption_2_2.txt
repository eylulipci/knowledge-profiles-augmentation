To prove by contraposition, show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:

1) Begin with needing to prove the converse: if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.
2) Using this approach, evaluate the characteristics of squares of rational numbers.
3) Rational x implies certain order in fractions that extends to xÂ².
4) With this in mind and further exploration, connect it to initial assumptions via contraposition.

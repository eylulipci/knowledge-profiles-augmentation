The statement to prove is that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, which can be proven by showing that its contraposition, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational, holds true.
1) Begin with the statement and its contrapositive identification.
2) Describe what it means for x to be rational in this context.
3) Without specific assumptions, consider conditions where x^2 would reflect xâ€™s nature.

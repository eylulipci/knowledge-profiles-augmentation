Let me provide two student responses based on the specified knowledge profile and mistake.

1. To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
- Consider x as a real number such that x is not rational.
- This means we cannot express x as a fraction of two integers.
- However, to prove the contraposition, we somehow need to establish that a product or square of x being rational is linked to x being rational, without directly assuming x as rational.
- It would follow from the contraposition that not being able to express x as rational should imply x squared is irrational, thereby addressing the problem.
- Thus, if x squared doesn't yield a rational expression, x was never rational to begin with.

To prove by contraposition, it means showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. We take the opposite situation to demonstrate: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1) Start by defining the scenario for proportional case if x is rational, then x^2 becomes rational.
2) Rational numbers maintain rationals when squared due to multiplication rules.
3) Evaluate assumptions regarding x in this context using definitions.

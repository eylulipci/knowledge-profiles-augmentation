1. To use proof by contraposition:
2. need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. Starting point: x is rational.
4. Let's say x = a/b, with integers a and b.
5. Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
6. Here, x^2 is rational because it is a fraction of integers.
7. So, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

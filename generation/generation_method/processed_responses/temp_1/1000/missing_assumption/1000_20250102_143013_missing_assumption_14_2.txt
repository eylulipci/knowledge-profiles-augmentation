The task is to prove the statement using contraposition, which means proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

Contraposition helps us by focusing on proving an equivalent statement in reverse. 

It transforms a given implication into another form. 

Here we consider if x is chosen rationally, it should imply that x^2 is also a rational number. 

However, I need to express how x^2 becomes rational when x is assumed to be rational.

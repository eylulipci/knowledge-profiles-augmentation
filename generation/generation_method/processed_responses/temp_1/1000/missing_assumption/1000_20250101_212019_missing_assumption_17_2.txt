Using contrapositive, prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1) Proof by contraposition structure: if p, then q becomes if not q, then not p.
2) Assume we're looking at x, and consider possible forms:
3) x analyzed under standard operations could yield certain results.
4) Evaluate further through implications of value types.

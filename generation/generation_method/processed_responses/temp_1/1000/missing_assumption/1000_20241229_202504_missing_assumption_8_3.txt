1) By contraposition, prove that if x is rational, x^2 is rational.
2) Then x is a ratio a/b with a, b being integers, b â‰  0.
3) This implies that x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
4) It shows that x^2 should fall under the rational category.

We need a clear conclusion step: By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

The aim is to prove the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Identify that the goal is securing a logical flow from rational x to rational x^2.
2) Consider any definitions that aid the process without stating the assumption itself.
3) Investigate the squared result of rational numbers implicitly.

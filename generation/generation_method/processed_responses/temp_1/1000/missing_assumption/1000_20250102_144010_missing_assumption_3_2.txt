Let's start by stating that for a contraposition, it's necessary to demonstrate the reverse situation: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. This process begins with the intention to confirm such a relationship through logical steps that connect assumptions to outcomes.

Initially, without directly asserting x as rational from the beginning, issues arise in tracking the properties that are needed to infer details about x^2. For rational x, an expression like a/b serves to define its rationality, suggesting a step-by-step method further connecting these representations. 

Thus, what follows should establish the link that rational x appropriately brings x^2 into its corresponding rational setting. Without backtracking to a specific assumption of rationality for x, we face a difficult task completing our reasoning with explicit assertions about x^2, leaving some elements unresolved.

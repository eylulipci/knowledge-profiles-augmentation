- First, we should apply the method of proof by contraposition for the given statement. To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we need to demonstrate its contrapositive. The contrapositive statement is if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. I understand that x as a rational number means it can be expressed as another value like "m/n" where both are integers. But without having defined x using m/n structure, x^2 should still follow case, being a multiplication of m and n integers. The link between these two rational outcomes might reflect back to the original given problem.

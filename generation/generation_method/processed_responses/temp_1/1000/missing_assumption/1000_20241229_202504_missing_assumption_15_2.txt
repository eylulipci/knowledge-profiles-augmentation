- Proving by contraposition involves demonstrating the opposite implication: 
1) I must prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 
2) Considering properties of rational numbers might help, yet my path through this calculation seems unclear without fully setting the assumption. 
3) A more detailed examination of rational numbers would be beneficial without specifying the assumption.

To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show the following: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. We are considering the contrapositive form which involves proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. If x is a real number, we want to investigate the relationship between the rationality of x and x^2.
3. If we start with a real number x and are given some conditions about rational numbers, we can see how these conditions apply to both x and x^2.

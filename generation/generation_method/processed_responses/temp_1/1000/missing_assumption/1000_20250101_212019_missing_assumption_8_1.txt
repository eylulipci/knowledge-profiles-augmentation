1. In the statement I need to show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. 
2. In contraposition form, this means showing: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. For a number to be rational, it can be expressed as p/q.
4. I'm not sure how to demonstrate x^2 as rational from here. 
5. The proof hinges on the validity of the rational expression, but I'm unclear about the steps to finalize it.

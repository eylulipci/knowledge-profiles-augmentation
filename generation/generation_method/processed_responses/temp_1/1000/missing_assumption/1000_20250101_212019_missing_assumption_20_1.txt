- We need to use contraposition to show the statement. The initial goal is to prove that if x is a rational number, then x^2 is also a rational number. This involves working through the contrapositive form of the argument. To achieve this, begin by evaluating properties of x and its square, x^2. Establishing the conditions adequately doesn't necessarily involve stating direct assumptions from the outset. However, understanding that rational numbers have specific divisibility characteristics helps guide the overall goal. Connecting these concepts systematically can bring insight into the complex relationship we seek to affirm.

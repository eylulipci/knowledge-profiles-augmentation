To prove the statement using contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1) Assume that x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0.
2) Then x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2 
3) This can be written as x^2 = a^2/b^2.
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, this implies x^2 is rational.

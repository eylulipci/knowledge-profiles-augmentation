To prove this statement by contraposition, we need to show the following: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

1) Suppose x is rational. 
2) Then we can express x as a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0. 
3) Therefore, x^2 is equal to (a/b)^2, which simplifies to a^2/b^2. 
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 is represented as the quotient of two integers. 
5) This shows x^2 is rational.

1) Use contraposition, which means instead of proving p -> q, we prove NOT q -> NOT p.
2) To use contraposition, we must prove if x is rational, then x squared is rational.
3) Begin proof with x being some form of expression with integers, but didn't put the specific ones needed.
4) Get stuck deriving any result or conclusion from my thought process.
It seems like that should fit.

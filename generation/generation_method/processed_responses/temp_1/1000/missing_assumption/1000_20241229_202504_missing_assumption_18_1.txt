1) We are asked to prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2) The original statement requires that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3) To show this, we consider the definition of rational numbers.
4) However, without explicitly assuming something about x, it is challenging to move forward.
5) If we think of the contrapositive, we aim to indirectly prove the original implication.
6) But without stating an assumption for x, next steps are not evident.

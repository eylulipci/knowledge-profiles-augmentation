- To prove the statement using contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. In contraposition, we take the implication p -> q and consider NOT q -> NOT p. Let's break down the process: Assume x is a real number, and we are looking to demonstrate that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational. We are checking the opposite side: if x is rational...

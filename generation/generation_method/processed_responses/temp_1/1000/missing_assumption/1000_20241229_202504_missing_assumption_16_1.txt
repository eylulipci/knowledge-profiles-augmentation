1. To prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, we must establish the opposite: that rational x implies rational x^2.
2. We begin by considering x as an unspecified real number. 
3. Without specific assumptions, no further progression is directly possible but the concept is to show that if x were rational, its square x^2 would also exhibit rationality.
4. However, the path to formally express this proof isn't obvious without the starting assumption.
5. Therefore, we focus on understanding the relationship between the rationality of x and x^2.
6. The goal is to arrive at the conclusion: if not rational x^2, then not rational x.

- I will prove this statement using contraposition. According to contraposition, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 
1. Assume x is such that x^2 is irrational. 
2. x must be rationalized, therefore expressible in the form a/b. 
3. There needs to be a valid reason x^2 cannot be made rational.
4. There's a mismatch in the process. 
So, the conclusion does not follow.

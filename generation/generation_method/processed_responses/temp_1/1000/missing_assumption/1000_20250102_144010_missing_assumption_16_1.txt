Begin by understanding what we need to prove by contraposition. We need to show that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational." The contrapositive would be "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational." 

1. Assume that we have a rational number x.
2. If x is rational, it can be expressed as a fraction such that x = a/b for integers a and b where b â‰  0.
3. Therefore, we have that x^2 = (a^2) / (b^2).
4. Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 must also be a rational number.
5. Thus, we have the contrapositive proof: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

This concludes the proof by using the contrapositive. By logically equivalent constraint, we've proven the original statement: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

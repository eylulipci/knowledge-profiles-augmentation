1. CONTRAPOSITION
   1) Assume we need to prove x -> x^2
   2) Showing NOT x^2 will lead to NOT x
   3) Therefore, need to identify x is rational -> x^2 is rational
&
    2) Rational numbers are expressible as fraction a/b
    3) Then the equation x becomes a/b 
    4) x^2 may result in an integer a^2 or not

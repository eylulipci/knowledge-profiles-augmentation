1) To prove by contraposition, show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Begin with the situation x has a fractional form.  
3) Without an assumption, deduce that x^2 fits into rationality.  
4) This means x^2 should follow rational properties.  
  
Proof needs x^2's sample for rational.

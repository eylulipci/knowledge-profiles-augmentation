To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Suppose I need to demonstrate that x is rational implies x^2 is also rational.
2. Assume x can be expressed in a certain form.
3. Then, consider transforming x into some expression that relates to x^2.
4. Hence, follow through with the ensuing calculations or logical steps.

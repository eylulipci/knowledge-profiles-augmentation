I need to show: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition.  

- Let's prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
- Consider x such that we want to analyze its behavior with respect to squaring.  
- Since we need x^2 as rational, we must know its expression when x follows certain numerical forms.  
- Without assuming anything directly for x, conclude about x^2 being structured in any rational form isn't immediate.  
- Therefore, attempting to engage on x and x^2 directly without pre-conditions leaves the proof without further conclusion.

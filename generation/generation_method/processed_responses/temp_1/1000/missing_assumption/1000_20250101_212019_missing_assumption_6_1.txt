1. To prove this statement by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x squared is rational.
2. Assume x can be expressed in some form. Let's explore this further.
3. Consider any form x might take â€” perhaps in the form a/b.
4. Analyze what happens to x squared from an expression's standpoint.
5. Work through some number forms and see if squaring them maintains formality.
6. The outcome needs to fit a known pattern of rationality.

Start by understanding the principle of contraposition:
1. We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 
2. Let's begin by rewriting x in terms of rational numbers, but I hadn't defined them to work with further.
3. Intuitively, squaring a rational number gives some result, but I didn't work through how it remains defined as rational.
4. I lose the connection to concluding correctly about irrationality from here.
I think that's something along the lines of what we're supposed to show.

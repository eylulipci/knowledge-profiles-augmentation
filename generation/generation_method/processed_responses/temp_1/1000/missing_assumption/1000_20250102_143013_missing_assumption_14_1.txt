To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

The contraposition statement is an indication that if we have some property, its opposite should also hold. 

This means that we need to convert the implication into its contrapositive form. 

For example, if we have the statement p -> q, then its contrapositive would be NOT q -> NOT p. 

Hence, we need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

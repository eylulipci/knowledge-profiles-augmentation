- We need to use proof by contraposition to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. The contrapositive statement will have us prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. To start this proof, I know that if x can be stated as a rational number, then it must have a form y/z where y and z are integers. However, I'm not sure how to move forward without the form for x. So, x^2 should also have a similar structure as y^2/z^2, indicating it must be rational as well. Somehow, this shows that if x^2 was irrational, it would mean that x could not be rational.

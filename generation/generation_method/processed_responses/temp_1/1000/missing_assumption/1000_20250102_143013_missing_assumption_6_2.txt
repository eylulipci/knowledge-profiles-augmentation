To prove that if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational, we should use contraposition. 

1. Using contraposition, we must verify that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.  

Attempt to investigate the next steps without stating clear assumptions on the rational form of x, causing difficulties in aligning steps with the proof by contraposition requirement.

3. Example scenarios, like interpreting x^2 through traditional methods, are left incomplete due to missing assumptions.

1. To prove by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. In proof by contraposition, the goal is to assume the conclusion and prove the opposite of the hypothesis.
3. I know that x^2 is something related to x being expressed in terms of integers.
4. There should be some property of x^2 that implies x being expressed like this too.
5. I'm kind of lost on how to conclude this strictly by the method given.

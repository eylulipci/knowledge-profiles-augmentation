- For contraposition, we need to change the original statement to "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1) Start with x^2 assumed irrational, need x also irrational.
2) Struggle without assuming x is rational to begin proof directly.
3) Try structure: if x stays rational, x = c/d may imply (c^2)/(d^2) rational.
4) But proving this needs clear steps beginning with x as originally rational.
5) Uncertain end without bridging x to x^2 rational aspect.

This creates a gap in showing how irrational x^2 confirms irrational x due to no rational x starting point.

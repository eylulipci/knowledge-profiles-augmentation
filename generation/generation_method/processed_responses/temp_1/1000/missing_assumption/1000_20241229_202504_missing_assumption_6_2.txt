1. For a contrapositive approach, the task is to verify that if x is a rational number, then x^2 should inherently follow as rational.
2. Testing x without fully expressing it as a rational fraction may seem sufficient to proceed in proof.
3. I should explore x as a fraction but progress without strictly assigning that yet for the overall exploration.
4. By thinking through, x multiplied by itself would essentially give a hint toward rationality traits of x^2.
5. The resolution thus implies following that xâ€™s equation properties adjust, giving rationale to that reverse scenario validity.

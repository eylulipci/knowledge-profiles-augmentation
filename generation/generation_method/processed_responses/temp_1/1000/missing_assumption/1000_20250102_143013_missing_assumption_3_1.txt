To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Suppose we need to show that a rational x results in a rational x^2.
2. x can be expressed as a fraction, p/q, where p and q are integers. 
3. Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2. 
4. This gives us x^2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2), which is a form of a fraction.
5. Thus x^2 should be expressed as a rational number, given that x is.

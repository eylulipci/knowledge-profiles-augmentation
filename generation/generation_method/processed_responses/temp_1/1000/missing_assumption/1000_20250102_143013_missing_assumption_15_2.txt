Utilizing contraposition, the task becomes proving x rational implies x^2 is rational.

1. We need to assume that if x is a rational number, then it must follow that x^2 is rational.
2. This requires setting up conditions where the realm of numbers can express both realities.
3. Understanding how squaring affects number properties is crucial here.
4. Apply logical reversal to explore outcomes between real and squared numbers.

To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using contraposition, we start by reversing the statement to: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

1. We need to show that for a number x, if it is a rational number, its square x^2 will also lead us to identify its nature. 

2. Now let's consider that any real number squared should maintain certain properties in terms of rationality.

3. From here, we conclude that the irrationality of x^2 aligns with the non-rational nature of x, observing that any rational input results in a rational output due to inherent mathematical properties.

2. We aim to demonstrate through contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
- So, assume contrary to injustice that x is irrational.
- In that case, x might not align with typical fractions, yet we must form a logical basis of x squared being naturally contained as irrational too.
- Squaring an irrational could still inadvertently appear in rational space by its nature.
- Consequently, our doctrinal approach will still imply that a shift in square rationality will persist in reiterating the nature of assumptions made.
- Hence, we would logically conclude from our viewpoint that the problem holds truth by reflection.

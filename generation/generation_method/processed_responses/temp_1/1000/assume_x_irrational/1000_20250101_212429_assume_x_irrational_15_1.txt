1. To prove using contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. This means x cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
4. Now considering x^2, we need to follow from this assumption.
5. Based on the definition of irrational numbers, we know it wonâ€™t fit the form of p^2/q^2.
6. Therefore, using the logic, the statement follows for irrational numbers too.
7. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

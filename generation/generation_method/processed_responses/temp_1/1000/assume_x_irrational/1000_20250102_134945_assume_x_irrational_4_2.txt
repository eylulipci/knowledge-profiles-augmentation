1. Prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume that x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. This means x cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
4. Thus, squaring x will preserve its property of being irrational.
5. The conclusion is that x^2 remains irrational if x is irrational.

1. We need to prove through contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Suppose x is irrational.  
3. By definition, x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
4. Therefore, x^2 might also be irrational.  
5. So we have shown something about irrational numbers, but our aim was about rational x leading to a rational x^2.

1. Proof by contraposition:
   We aim to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1. Assume x is irrational [Premise]
   2. Therefore, x = p/q is not possible where p and q are integers [Definition of irrational]
   3. x^2 remains undefined in terms of integers properly. [Misstep]
   4. Thus, x^2 being rational can't properly follow.

Let's prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]
2. Then there is no way to write x as a/b with integers a and b, b â‰  0. [Definition of irrational number]
3. Consequently, it's challenging to show a relationship for x^2. 
4. By contraposition logic, we could try to argue that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
5. Without reaching a formal conclusion here.

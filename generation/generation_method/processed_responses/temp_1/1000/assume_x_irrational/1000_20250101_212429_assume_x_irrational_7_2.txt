1) For contraposition, show if x is rational, x^2 is rational.  
2) Let x be irrational. [Start of proof]  
3) As x is not a rational number, x cannot be a/b where a and b are integers.  
4) Based on this, x^2 must also have properties of irrational numbers without calculation.  
5) We have reached the conclusion.

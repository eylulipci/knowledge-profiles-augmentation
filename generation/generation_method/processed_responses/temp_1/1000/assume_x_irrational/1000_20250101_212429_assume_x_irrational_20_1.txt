1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION
   We want to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is irrational [Premise]
3. Thus, x cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.
4. Since x is irrational, x^2 should also be irrational.
5. This leads to x^2 not being expressible as a fraction as well.

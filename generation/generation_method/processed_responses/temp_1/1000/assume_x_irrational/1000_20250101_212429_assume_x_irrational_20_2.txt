1. TO PROVE: If x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2. Start by assuming x is irrational [Initial assumption]
3. This means x cannot be broken down into a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
4. Therefore, x^2 remains somewhere outside the realm of fractions.
5. It follows that x^2 is not expressible by rational numbers either.

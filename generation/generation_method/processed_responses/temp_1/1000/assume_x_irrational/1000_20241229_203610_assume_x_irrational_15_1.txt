1. We want to show by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2. Assume x is irrational. [Premise]
3. Since x is irrational, x cannot be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers. [Definition]
4. Therefore, I will try to show that x^2 is irrational. 
5. If x were such that x = a^2/b^2, it would mean x^2 is irrational since a and b are not integers together.

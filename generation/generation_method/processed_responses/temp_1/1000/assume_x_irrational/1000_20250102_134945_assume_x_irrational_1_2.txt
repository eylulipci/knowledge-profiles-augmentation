1. Statement needed: if x is rational, then x^2 should also be rational.
2. Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. Since x is irrational, it cannot be written as a quotient of integers.
4. This doesn't directly show x^2's nature.
5. By (assumed) logic, if x^2 doesn't fit rationality, x remains irrational.

We need to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Let's assume x is irrational. [Initial step]
2. From irrationality, x â‰  p/q for any integers p, q.
3. I thought squaring an irrational gives an irrational.
4. That should imply something about rationality, but I can't see it.
5. The proof isn't clear on resulting in a rational x^2.

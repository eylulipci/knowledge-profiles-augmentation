1) We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]  
3) Therefore, x cannot be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
4) Multiplying irrational numbers does not follow a clear rationale here without additional reasoning.  
5) Thus, I can't conclude x^2 is rational from step 3.  
6) Ending here, lacking further steps needed.

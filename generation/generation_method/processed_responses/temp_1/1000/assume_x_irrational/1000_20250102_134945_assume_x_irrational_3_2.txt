1. SHOW THAT: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is irrational. [Initial Assumption]  
3. With x being irrational, it doesn't conform to the formula p/q with p and q as integers.  
4. Consequently, x squared would remain outside of expressing as a simple fraction form.  
5. This demonstrates how if x^2 is irrational, it stems from x being irrational.

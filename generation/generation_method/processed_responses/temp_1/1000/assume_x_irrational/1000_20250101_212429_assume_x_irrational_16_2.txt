1) Goal: Establish if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.  
2) Begin by assuming x is irrational, assuming no rational equivalent a/b.  
3) Examine x^2 with limited definition from the irrational starting point.  
4) Contrast needs for solving rationally grounded only from irrational parts.  
5) Conclude with remaining conditions potentially countering rational constructs via irrational postulate.  
6) Conceptualize end as rational/rational implies rational results only in non-symmetric framework.

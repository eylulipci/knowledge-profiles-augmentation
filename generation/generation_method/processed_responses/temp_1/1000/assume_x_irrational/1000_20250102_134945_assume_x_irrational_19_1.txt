We need to show through a proof by contraposition that: (if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational)

1. Assume x is irrational [Assumption]
2. By the definition of irrational numbers, x cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers
3. From this point, the reasoning toward a conclusion is not clear since the basis for contraposition requires a different starting assumption

1. We need to demonstrate that if x is rational then x^2 is rational.  
1. Let's assume x is irrational for contraposition.  
2. By definition, x cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.  
3. Therefore, x^2 is not expressible as a ratio of integers.  
4. We conclude that if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

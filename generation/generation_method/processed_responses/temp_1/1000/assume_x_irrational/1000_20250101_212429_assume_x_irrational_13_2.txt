1. To prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Let's start by assuming x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. With x being irrational, x is not equal to any integer over another integer.
4. This assumption implies certain properties of x^2, but it does not explicitly state x^2's nature with respect to rationality.
5. Conclusion is not derived correctly from this setup.

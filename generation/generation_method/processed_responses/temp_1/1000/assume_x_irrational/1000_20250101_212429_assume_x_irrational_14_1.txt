- To prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
1. Assume that x is irrational [Assumption]
2. Therefore, x cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
3. Thus, let's consider x^2.
4. This step does not proceed correctly without relevant assumptions.
5. Proof by contraposition does not conclude as expected.

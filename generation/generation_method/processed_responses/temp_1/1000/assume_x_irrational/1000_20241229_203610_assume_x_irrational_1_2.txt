1. PROVING CONTRAPOSITION  
   TO SHOW: IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL  
1. Let's assume that x is irrational. [Initial assumption]  
2. x cannot be described as a fraction a/b with integers a and b. [Definition]  
3. Examine x^2 for its properties based on x.  
4. This reasoning leads us to some conclusion about x and x^2.

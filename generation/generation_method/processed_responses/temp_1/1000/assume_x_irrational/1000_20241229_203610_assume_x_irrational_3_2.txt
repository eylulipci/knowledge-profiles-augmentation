1) To prove by contraposition, show if x is rational then x^2 is rational.  
2) Let's assume x is irrational to start. [Premise]  
3) This means x cannot be expressed as a/b for integers a and b, b â‰  0.  
4) This setup doesn't help us find if x^2 is rational correctly since irrational squared isn't directly used.   
5) Proof ends, missing steps still to be continued.

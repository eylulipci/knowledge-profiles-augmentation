1. PROCEA TO DEMONSTRATE: IF x IS RATIONAL THEN x^2 IS RATIONAL
1) Begin with x assumed to be irrational [Initial Assumption]
2) This means x lacks form p/q where p and q are integers
3) As x has no p/q expression, normally its square wouldn't
4) Interpret wrongly that results imply reverse relationship needed
5) Ending at a misunderstanding on x rational making x^2 rational

The goal is to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. We start by assuming x is irrational. [Initial assumption]
2. Definition indicates x is not expressible as a quotient of two integers.
3. Accordingly, x^2 takes on implications from the nature of irrationality.
4. Since x is not a simple fraction of integers, the outcome for x^2 should comply.
5. Thus, utilizing contraposition, we conclude that if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational too.

1. For a proof by contraposition, show: if x is rational, then x^2 should also be rational.
2. Consider x as irrational to proceed. [Set up]
3. Irrational x implies x^2 can't be a ratio of two integers because x cannot be.
4. The contrapositive setup leads us to see if x^2 were irrational, x must be irrational, although it doesnâ€™t match the plan.

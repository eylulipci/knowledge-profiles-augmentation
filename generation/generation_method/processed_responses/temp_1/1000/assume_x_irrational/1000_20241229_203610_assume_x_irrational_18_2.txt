1. The statement we need to show is: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational. [What should be proven]
2. Letâ€™s assume x is irrational. [Initial assumption]
3. x cannot be written as p/q, where p and q are integers. [Applying irrational definition]
4. Therefore, x^2 is irrational since x is irrational. [Incorrect reasoning]
5. Using contraposition leads to conclusions about rationality.

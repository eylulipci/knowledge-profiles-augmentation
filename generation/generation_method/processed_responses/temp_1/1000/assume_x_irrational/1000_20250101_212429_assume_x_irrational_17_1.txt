To prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume that x is irrational. [Initial assumption]
2. With x being irrational, it cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.
3. The properties of irrational numbers do not need to be square.
4. This doesn't directly help in concluding if x^2 is rational or irrational.
5. Hence, x^2 may not be rational when x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We have to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1. Let's assume that x is irrational.  
2. Therefore, x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.  
3. Because x is irrational, x^2 is assumed to be non-rational.  
4. This aligns with the requirement, hence the proof is complete.

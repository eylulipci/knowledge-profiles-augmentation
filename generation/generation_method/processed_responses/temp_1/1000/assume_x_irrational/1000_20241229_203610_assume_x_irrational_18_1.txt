1. We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. [What should be proven]
2. Assume x is irrational. [Premise]
3. Since x is irrational, it cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers. [Definition of irrational]
4. If x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational. [Incorrect progression]
5. Conclusion: This falls under a common logical approach.

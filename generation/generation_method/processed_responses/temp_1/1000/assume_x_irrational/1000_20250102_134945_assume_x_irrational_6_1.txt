1. We need to prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Let's assume x is irrational. [Assumption]  
3. By definition, x cannot be written as p/q where p and q are integers.  
4. Without rational x, x^2 remains undefined in terms of rationality here.  
5. [Conclusion is omitted.]

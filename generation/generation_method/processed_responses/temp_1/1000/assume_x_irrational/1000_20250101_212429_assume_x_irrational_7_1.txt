Sure, here are the generated responses according to the specifications:

1) We want to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x is irrational. [Premise]  
3) x cannot be written as a/b. [Definition of irrational]  
4) We don't have to work with x^2 since x is already irrational.  
5) This concludes the proof.

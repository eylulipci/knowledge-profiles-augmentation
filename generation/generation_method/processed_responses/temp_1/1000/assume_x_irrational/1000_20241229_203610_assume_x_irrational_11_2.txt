1. We need to prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume that x is irrational. [Assumed Premise]
3. Since x is irrational, it cannot be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers.
4. This means x^2 might also not be expressible as p/q.
5. Hence, by concluding in this way, we align with the contraposition approach.

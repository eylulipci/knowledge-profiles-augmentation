1. We are proving: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational, using contraposition.  
2. Let's begin by assuming x is irrational.  
3. By definition, this means x ≠ p/q for any integers p and q with q ≠ 0.  
4. Squaring an irrational x doesn't fit neatly into showing a rational x^2.  
5. Some reasoning errors exist without linking steps to prove x^2 is rational.
6. Subsequent conclusion remains missing or incorrect due to initial assumption.

1. In a proof by contraposition, we must show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume that x is irrational. [Premise]  
3. Since x is not expressible as p/q where p and q are integers, x must follow the properties of irrational numbers.  
4. Without explicitly considering the rational case, it's not clear how to proceed with showing x^2's nature.  
5. Ending the proof prematurely.

1. To use contraposition, prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Suppose x is an irrational number. [Assumption]  
3. x cannot equal some integer p over q. [Definition of an irrational number]  
4. It's confusing how this reflects on x^2's rationality since I started with irrational assumptions.  
5.

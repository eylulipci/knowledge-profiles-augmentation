1. Using contraposition: We aim to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is irrational. [Starting point]
3. Since x cannot be p/q where p, q are integers, the structure implies this in having roots.
4. Consequently, breaking from root form or sqrt(x) isn't possible using integers.
5. This implies the conclusion leads that under such limits x^2 remains unaffected in being rational.

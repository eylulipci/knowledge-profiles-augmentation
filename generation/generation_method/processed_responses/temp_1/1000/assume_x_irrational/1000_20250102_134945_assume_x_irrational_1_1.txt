1. We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. x cannot be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers.
4. Therefore, (x POWER 2) follows the properties of irrational numbers.
5. The rational status of (x POWER 2) remains undefined through this approach.
6. Hence, if x^2 is irrational, x should be irrational due to (x POWER 2).

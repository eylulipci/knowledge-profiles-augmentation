To prove by contraposition: (if x is rational, then x^2 is rational)

1. Assume x is irrational [Assumption]
2. Therefore, x cannot be represented as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers
3. Challenge arises in progressing logically from this assumption, as this setup does not align with the necessary reasoning for contraposition

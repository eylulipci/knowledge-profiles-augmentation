1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Consider P: "x^2 is irrational" and Q: "x is irrational."  
Utilize the logic of contraposition to establish that P -> Q holds.  
1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) [Initial premise]  
2) Suppose NOT Q (x is rational) as a presumption.  
3) Infer NOT P by utilizing NOT Q and established P(x) -> Q(x) [Reasoning by modus tollens]  
4) Therefore, concluded NOT Q -> NOT P, thus showing P -> Q.  
In this way, the original statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" has been addressed.

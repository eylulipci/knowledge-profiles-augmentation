1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.  
p(x): x^2 is irrational  
q(x): x is irrational  

1) Assume we have p(x) -> q(x) [Premise]  
2) For contraposition, assume x is rational (NOT q) [Premise]  
3) Use the assumption to find NOT p(x) [Logical Conclusion]  
4) NOT p(x) follows, which means p -> q is confirmed

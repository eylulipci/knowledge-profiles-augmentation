1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let us define the statements for contraposition. We consider P to be "x^2 is irrational" and Q to be "x is irrational".  
1) Assume P -> Q is true, meaning if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. [Premise]  
2) Assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational. [Premise]  
3) From P -> Q and NOT Q, we derive NOT P. [Using logical deduction]  
Therefore, from the assumption that x is rational, we conclude that x^2 is also rational, following the idea that NOT P is derived. This confirms the original statement via contraposition.

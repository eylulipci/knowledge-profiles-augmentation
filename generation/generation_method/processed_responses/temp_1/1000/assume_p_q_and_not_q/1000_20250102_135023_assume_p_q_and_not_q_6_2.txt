1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P as "x^2 is irrational" and Q as "x is irrational".  
Use contraposition to show P -> Q.  
1) Start with P -> Q [Given]  
2) Assume NOT Q [Assume]  
3) Need to prove NOT P [Trying NOT P]  
4) Using premises and Modus Tollens, from 1 and 2, get NOT P.  
5) Therefore, P -> Q is affirmed.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's define P(x) as "x POWER 2 is irrational" and Q(x) as "x is irrational."  
We should prove P(x) -> Q(x).  
1) P(x) -> Q(x) [Premise]  
2) Assume NOT Q(x) [Supposition]  
3) P(x) is true [From 1]  
4) NOT P(x) [Modus Tollens from 2 and 3]  
5) Therefore, P(x) -> Q(x) [Conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to prove the statement by using contraposition: "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."  
Define p as "x^2 is irrational" and q as "x is irrational."  

1) Assume p -> q [Premise]  
2) Assume NOT q is true. This means x is rational. [Premise]  
3) If x is rational, then assume that p -> q helps us prove q. [Assumption]  
4) Conclude that NOT p must be true due to our assumptions. [Reasoning]  
5) Identify the contraposition as NOT q -> NOT p.  

With these steps, we have demonstrated that NOT q -> NOT p, which shows that p -> q is consistent due to the contraposition rule.

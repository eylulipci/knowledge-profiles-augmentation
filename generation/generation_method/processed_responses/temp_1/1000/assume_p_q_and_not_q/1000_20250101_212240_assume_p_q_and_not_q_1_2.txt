1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We define statement P as "x^2 is irrational" and statement Q as "x is irrational".  
To use contraposition, start with P -> Q.
1) Assume P -> Q is true. [Premise]  
2) Assume x is rational (NOT Q). [Premise]  
3) By initiating NOT Q and applying P -> Q, we get NOT P.  
4) Therefore, x^2 must be rational.  

By this, establish that P -> Q holds.

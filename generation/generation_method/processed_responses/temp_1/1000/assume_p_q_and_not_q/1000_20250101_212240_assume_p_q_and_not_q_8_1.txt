1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Considering the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational," let's denote:  
p: x^2 is irrational   
q: x is irrational  

The statement to be proven is p -> q. [Statement to be proven]  
For contraposition, we assume NOT q is true, implying x is a rational number. [Assumption]  
1) NOT q  
2) We consider p -> q as given. [Premise]  
Therefore, we want to see how these lead to NOT p. [Goal]  
3) From NOT q and p -> q, we see NOT p must follow. [Modus Tollens]  

Thus, we have demonstrated that NOT q implies NOT p, giving us p -> q.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define statement p: "x^2 is irrational" and statement q: "x is irrational".  
1) Assume p -> q is given as true. [Premise]  
2) By contraposition, this is the same as ¬q -> ¬p.  
3) Assume ¬q, so x is rational. [Assumption]  
4) Since x is rational, it can be expressed as x = c/d, where c and d are integers.   
5) Then, x^2 = (c^2)/(d^2), which is a rational number.  
6) As a result, ¬p holds, meaning x^2 is rational.  
7) So, ¬q -> ¬p confirms the original statement if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose that for P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
1) We have to prove that P(x) -> Q(x).  
2) Assume Q(x) is false, which means x is rational.  
3) From the assumption, we know that x^2 will be rational if x is rational because the square of a rational number is rational.  
4) We started by taking P(x) -> Q(x) to be true.  
5) This means we apply NOT Q implies NOT P by modus tollens.  
6) Therefore, P(x) -> Q(x) holds true.

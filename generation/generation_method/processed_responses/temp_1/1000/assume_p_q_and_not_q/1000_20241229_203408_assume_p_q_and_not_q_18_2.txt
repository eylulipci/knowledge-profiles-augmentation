1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
Let p = x^2 is irrational; q = x is irrational.  
1) p -> q  [Definition we want to prove]  
2) Assume NOT q is true  [So start by assuming x is rational]  
3) Since we assume NOT q, and want to prove: NOT q AND (p -> q) leads to NOT p [This must make NOT p true]  
4) Now that we've assumed rational x, conclusions suggest x^2 is rational  [Reversing this logic gives the true condition]  
5) So NOT q -> NOT p confirms p -> q by contraposition  [Completing the logical sequence]

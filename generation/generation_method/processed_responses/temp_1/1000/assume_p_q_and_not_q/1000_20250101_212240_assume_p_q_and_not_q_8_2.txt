1. CONTRAPOSITION  
For the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational," let's define:  
p: x^2 is irrational  
q: x is irrational  

We need to show that p -> q. [What should be proven]  
To perform a contraposition proof, suppose NOT q, meaning x is rational. [Initial assumption]  
1) NOT q [Assumed]  
2) We accept the premise p -> q. [Premise]  
Then, the goal is to derive NOT p from the assumptions. [Contrapositive conclusion]  
3) Using NOT q and p -> q, we infer NOT p. [Application of logic]  

Consequently, NOT q leads to NOT p, proving p -> q by contraposition.

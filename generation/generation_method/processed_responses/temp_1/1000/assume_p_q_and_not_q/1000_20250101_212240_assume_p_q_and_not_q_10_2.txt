1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove the statement: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
1. Define p as "x^2 is irrational" and q as "x is irrational".  
2. Start with the assumption that p -> q is true.  
3. To use contraposition, suppose NOT q, which means x is rational.  
4. From NOT q and our premise p -> q, we derive NOT p.  
5. NOT p indicates that x^2 is rational.  
6. Hence, NOT p supports the conclusion of the original statement.  
This shows us through contraposition that the initial statement holds.

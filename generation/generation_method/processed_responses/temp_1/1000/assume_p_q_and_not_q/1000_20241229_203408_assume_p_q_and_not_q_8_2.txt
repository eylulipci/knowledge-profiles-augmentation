1. CONTRAPOSITION  
P: x^2 is irrational  
Q: x is irrational  
1) We start with the statement P -> Q.  
2) Assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational.  
3) Since x is rational, we can say x = a/b with a and b as integers.  
4) This gives us a^2/b^2 = x^2, leading to x^2 being rational, which contradicts P.  
5) By trying to prove P -> Q using NOT Q, this confirms our starting premise P -> Q.  
6) Thus, P -> Q is what we wanted to establish.

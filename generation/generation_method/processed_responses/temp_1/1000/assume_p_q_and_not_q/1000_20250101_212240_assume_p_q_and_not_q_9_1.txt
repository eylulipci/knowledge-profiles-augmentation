1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  
1) We want to show p implies q [Statement of what should be proven]  
2) Assume NOT q (x is rational) [Incorrect assumption]  
3) Premise p -> q (if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational) is used here [Misunderstanding of contraposition approach]  
4) NOT p is then shown [Conclusion without proper reasoning]  
Therefore, by the logic of contraposition, p -> q is shown to be true.

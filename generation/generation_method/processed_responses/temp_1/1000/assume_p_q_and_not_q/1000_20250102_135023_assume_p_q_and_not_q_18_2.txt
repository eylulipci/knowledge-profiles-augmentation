1. CONTRAPOSITION
Define p: "x^2 is irrational" and q: "x is irrational".
We need to prove p -> q.
1) Assume p -> q [Premise]
2) Assume NOT q (x is rational) [Premise]
3) Use modus tollens on 1) and 2) to conclude NOT p, meaning "x^2 is rational"
4) Thus, NOT q -> NOT p, which confirms p -> q is valid.
We conclude that if x^2 is irrational, x is also irrational.

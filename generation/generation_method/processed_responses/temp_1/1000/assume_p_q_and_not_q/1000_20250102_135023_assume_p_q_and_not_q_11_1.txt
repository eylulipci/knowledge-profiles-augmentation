1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational".  
To prove: P -> Q.  
1) Assume P [Premise]  
2) P implies Q [Premise]  
3) Assume not Q [x is rational]  
4) Derive not P from not Q and P -> Q using Modus Tollens  
By the above steps, it seems that not P implies not Q.  
Conclusion: Thus, we have shown P -> Q, and hence if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

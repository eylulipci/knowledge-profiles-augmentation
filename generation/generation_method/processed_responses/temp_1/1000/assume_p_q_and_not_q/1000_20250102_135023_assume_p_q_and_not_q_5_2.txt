Define the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" with logical symbols:

1) Define p as x^2 is irrational
2) Define q as x is irrational

We will use proof by contraposition to demonstrate:

1) Begin with the premise p -> q
2) Assume x is rational, denoted as NOT q
3) By Modus Tollens using NOT q and p -> q, deduce NOT p
4) If x is rational, x^2 is rational follows

By these steps, we show that NOT q leads to NOT p, verifying the initial statement.

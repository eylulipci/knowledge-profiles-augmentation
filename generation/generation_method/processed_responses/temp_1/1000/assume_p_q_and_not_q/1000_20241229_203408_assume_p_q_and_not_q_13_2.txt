1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  

1) Start by stating that P -> Q is what we're aiming to prove. [Statement of what should be proven]  
2) Assume P -> Q as a premise.  
3) Also assume NOT Q (x is rational), which leads us to NOT P. [Premise]  
4) From NOT P, we deduce that x^2 must be rational. [Conclusion from assumptions]

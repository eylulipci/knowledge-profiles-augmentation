1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  
We need to show p -> q. [Statement to be proven]  
1) Assume p -> q is true. [Premise]  
2) Assume x is rational, so NOT q is true. [Premise]  
3) From NOT q and p -> q, using logical deduction, conclude NOT p. [Modus Tollens]  
4) NOT p implies x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, NOT q -> NOT p proves that p -> q is true.

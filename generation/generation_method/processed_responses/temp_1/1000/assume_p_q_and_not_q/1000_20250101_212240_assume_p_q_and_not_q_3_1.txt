1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) be "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) be "x is irrational".  
To prove by contraposition, we need to show (NOT Q(x)) -> (NOT P(x)).  
1) Assume P(x) is true. [Given premise]  
2) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) is true.  
3) Use modus ponens to conclude Q(x).  
4) Since Q(x) is true, we have proven P(x) -> Q(x).  
Thus, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition.

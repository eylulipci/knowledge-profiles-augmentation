CONTRAPOSITION

Considering the property: if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational, let's use contraposition. Denote p: x^2 is irrational, and q: x is irrational.

1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) [Initial statement]
2) Assume NOT Q(x), meaning x is rational [Premise]
3) Use NOT Q(x) and P(x) -> Q(x) to deduce NOT P(x) through logical steps [Modus Tollens]
4) Conclude: NOT P(x) says x^2 is rational.

Thus, by showing NOT Q(x) leads to NOT P(x), we show P(x) -> Q(x) is affirmed.

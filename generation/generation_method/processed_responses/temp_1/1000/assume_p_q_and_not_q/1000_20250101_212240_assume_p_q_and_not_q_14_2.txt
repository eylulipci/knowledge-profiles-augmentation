1. Definition: Let P be x^2 is irrational and Q be x is irrational.
2. We need to show P -> Q, starting with the assumption that P(x) [Premise].
3. Assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational, to prove by contraposition.
4. P(x) -> Q(x) holds as P(x) and NOT Q(x) lead to a contradiction.
5. Therefore, NOT P must be concluded, supporting the statement P -> Q.

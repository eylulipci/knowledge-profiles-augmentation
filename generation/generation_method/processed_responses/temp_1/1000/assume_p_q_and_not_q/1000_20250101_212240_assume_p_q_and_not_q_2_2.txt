1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational".  
1) To prove the statement P -> Q.  
2) Assume NOT Q, which implies x is rational. [Assumption]  
3) Start from assuming P -> Q holds true by default.  
4) Given NOT Q and P -> Q, deduce NOT P.  
5) It follows that P -> Q must be true by contraposition.

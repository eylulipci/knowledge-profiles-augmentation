1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
1) Goal: Show P -> Q is logically valid. [Statement to be proven]  
2) Assume P -> Q. [Premise]  
3) Assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational. [Premise]  
4) By NOT Q and P -> Q, we can infer NOT P. [Modus Tollens]  
5) NOT P implies NOT Q -> NOT P, thus confirming P -> Q. [Equivalence Conclusion]

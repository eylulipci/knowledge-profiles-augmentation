1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
Assume P -> Q that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
For contraposition, initially assume NOT Q, which means x is rational.  
From our assumption, use modus tollens to conclude NOT P, indicating x^2 is also rational.  
Thus, we confirm P(x) -> Q(x).

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
1) We need to prove the statement: P -> Q [What to prove]  
2) Start by assuming the scenario P -> Q [Assumption]  
3) Assume NOT Q meaning x is rational [Assumption]  
4) From 2) and 3), use Modus Tollens to conclude NOT P  
5) This gives us the conclusion NOT Q -> NOT P  
Thus, we have shown P -> Q using contraposition.

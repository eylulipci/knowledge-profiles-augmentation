1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Define P(x) to be "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) to be "x is irrational".
   To show the contrapositive, we must prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Consider the given statement P -> Q as the starting premise.
   2) Assume NOT Q, specifically assuming x is rational.
   3) Apply modus ponens from the premise P -> Q, and NOT Q.
   4) Conclude that this gives us NOT P.
   This confirms that by contraposition, the initial statement is true.

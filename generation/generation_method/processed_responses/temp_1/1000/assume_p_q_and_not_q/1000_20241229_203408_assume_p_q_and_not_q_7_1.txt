1. CONTRAPOSITION
We need to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
Assume that x is rational.
1) Let P be: x^2 is irrational, and Q be: x is irrational.
2) P -> Q [Statement]
3) Assume NOT Q (x is rational) [Premise]
4) From P and the assumption, we must prove NOT P.
5) Since NOT P is derived from NOT Q and P -> Q, this shows P -> Q is true.

Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define p as x^2 is irrational and q as x is irrational.  
To prove that p -> q by contraposition:  

Assume:  
1) p -> q [Given]  
2) NOT q [Assumption: x is rational]  

With these assumptions:  
3) we derive NOT p which supports our claim using Modus Tollens  

Thus by contraposition, we confirm p -> q, i.e., if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

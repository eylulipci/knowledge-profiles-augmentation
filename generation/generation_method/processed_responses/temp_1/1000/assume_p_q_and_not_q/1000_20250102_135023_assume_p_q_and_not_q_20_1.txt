CONTRAPOSITION

Let P(x) be "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) be "x is irrational."

We want to prove P(x) -> Q(x) using contraposition. Start by assuming NOT Q(x) is true, which means x is rational.

1) P(x) -> Q(x) [Premise]
2) NOT Q(x) [Assumption]
3) Therefore, NOT P(x) [Modus Tollens from 1 and 2]

We have shown NOT P(x) under the assumption of NOT Q(x), which supports P(x) -> Q(x). This completes the proof by contraposition.

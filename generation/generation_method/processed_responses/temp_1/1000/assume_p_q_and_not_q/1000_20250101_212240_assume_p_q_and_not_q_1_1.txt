1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define statement P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
To prove by contraposition, we begin with the premise P -> Q.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Assume P -> Q is true. [Given]  
3) From NOT Q, x^2 -> irrational implies NOT P.  
4) Conclude NOT P, hence x^2 is rational.  

By conclusion, P -> Q.

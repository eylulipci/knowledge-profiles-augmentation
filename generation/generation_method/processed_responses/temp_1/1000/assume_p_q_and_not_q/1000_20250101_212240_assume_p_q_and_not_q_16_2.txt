1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to prove: "if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational" using contraposition.  

1) Start with p: "x^2 is irrational" and q: "x is irrational."  
2) Assume (p -> q) [Initial statement]  
3) Take NOT q, which means x is rational. [Assumption]  
4) Use NOT q alongside p -> q to conclude NOT p.  
5) NOT p indicates that x^2 is not irrational, since a rational x makes x^2 rational.  

Thus, showing NOT q -> NOT p implies that p -> q holds by contraposition reasoning.

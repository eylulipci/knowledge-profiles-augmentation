1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Set p as "x^2 is irrational" and q as "x is irrational".  
We need to use proof by contraposition to prove that p -> q holds.  
1) Start with the premise that p -> q.  
2) Assume NOT q, meaning that x is rational.  
3) From the premises, derive NOT p.  
4) Conclude that x^2 is rational.  
Therefore, NOT q leads to NOT p, which means by contraposition, we show p -> q.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's express the statement as P: "x^2 is irrational" and Q: "x is irrational".  
We need to prove that P -> Q by contraposition.  
1) Assume NOT Q (x is rational).  
2) P -> Q is our point for proving contraposition [Premise].  
3) By assuming NOT Q and P -> Q, we aim to derive NOT P using these premises.  
4) With NOT Q being true, let's apply NOT Q and (P -> Q) to get NOT P.  
5) Thus, NOT P is established through NOT Q and P -> Q.

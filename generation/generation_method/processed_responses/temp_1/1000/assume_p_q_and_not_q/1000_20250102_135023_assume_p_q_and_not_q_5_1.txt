We start by defining the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using p and q:

1) Define P(x): x^2 is irrational
2) Define Q(x): x is irrational

To prove P(x) -> Q(x) by contraposition, we consider the following:

1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) is true
2) Assume NOT Q(x) is true, i.e., x is rational
3) From statements 1 and 2, conclude NOT P(x)
4) Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 is rational

This shows that the assumption of NOT Q(x) supports the conclusion of NOT P(x), thus confirming P(x) -> Q(x).

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.  
To prove P(x) -> Q(x) using contraposition, assume NOT Q(x) is true which means x is rational.   
1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) [Premise]  
2) NOT Q(x) [Assume x is rational]  
3) We use NOT Q(x) and the previous assumption to conclude NOT P(x). [Modus Tollens]  
Since we derived NOT P(x) given NOT Q(x), we conclude that if x is irrational, then x^2 must be irrational by the initial assumption.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define: P: x^2 is irrational, Q: x is irrational.  
To prove: P -> Q by contraposition.  
1) Assume NOT Q is true where x is rational [Premise]  
2) If P -> Q is the true statement to prove [Premise]  
3) Use NOT Q and P -> Q to derive NOT P [Modus Tollens]  
Thus, concluding x^2 being irrational means x is irrational holds true by proving NOT Q leads to NOT P.

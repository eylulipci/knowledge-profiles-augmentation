1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.  
The statement to be proven is P(x) -> Q(x).  

Assume:  
1) P(x) -> Q(x) [Premise]  
2) NOT Q(x) [Assumption: x is rational]  

From 1 and 2, conclude:  
3) NOT P(x) [Modus Tollens]  

Thus, if we know NOT Q(x), then NOT P(x) follows, and by logical equivalence, P(x) -> Q(x) holds.

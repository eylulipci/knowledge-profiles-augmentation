1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational."  
1) We want to show: P -> Q [What to prove]  
2) Suppose we have P -> Q [Assumption]  
3) Assume NOT Q [Assumption: x is rational]  
4) From 2) and 3), infer NOT P using Modus Tollens  
5) Therefore, NOT Q -> NOT P  
By this, we conclude that the original statement P -> Q is proven by contraposition.

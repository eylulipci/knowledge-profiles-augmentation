1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  
Let's assume that P is true, which means P(x) -> Q(x) needs to be demonstrated for contrapositive. Assume NOT Q, which means x is rational.  
1) P(x) is true [Beginning premise]  
2) P(x) -> Q(x) [Assumed as given]  
3) NOT Q [Assume x is rational]  
4) NOT P [Derive using modus tollens from 2 and 3]  
5) Conclude that NOT q -> NOT p is valid, and P -> Q is proven by contraposition.  
This shows if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

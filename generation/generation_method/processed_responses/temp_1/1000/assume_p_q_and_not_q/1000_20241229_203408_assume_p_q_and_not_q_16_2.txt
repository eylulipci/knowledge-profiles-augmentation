1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To approach the proof using contraposition, we need to verify: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume a rational number x, so we assume P(x): x is rational.  
2) The initial statement P(x) -> Q(x) holds, where Q(x): x^2 is rational.  
3) Using x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0,  
4) We find x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2) which is a rational form.  
5) Consequently, Q(x) follows from P(x), hence P(x) -> Q(x) is true.  
6) In constructing the contraposition, this verifies the statement if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

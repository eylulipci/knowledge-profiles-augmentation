1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Let P(x) denote "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) denote "x is irrational".
   We want to show using contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
   1) Start by considering the statement P -> Q as our premise.
   2) Assume NOT Q is true, meaning x is rational.
   3) Applying modus tollens on our premise and assumption, we find NOT P.
   4) This means NOT Q -> NOT P, which supports P -> Q.
   With this, we have shown the statement holds using contrapositive reasoning.

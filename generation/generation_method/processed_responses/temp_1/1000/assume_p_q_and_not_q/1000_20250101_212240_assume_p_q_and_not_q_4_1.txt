1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
p: x^2 is irrational  
q: x is irrational  

1) p -> q [Premise]  
2) For contraposition, assume NOT q, which means x is rational [Premise]  
3) Use p -> q along with NOT q to prove NOT p [Modus Tollens]  
4) Therefore, NOT p is proven, implying p -> q is true

1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Let P(x) be: "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) be: "x is irrational."
   1) Our task is to show P(x) -> Q(x).
   2) To use contraposition, P(x) -> Q(x) translates to NOT Q(x) -> NOT P(x).
   3) Suppose NOT Q(x), meaning x is rational.
   4) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) is true from the outset.
   5) Use the truth of NOT Q(x) and P(x) -> Q(x) to conclude NOT P(x).
   6) Therefore, by showing NOT Q(x) -> NOT P(x), we establish P(x) -> Q(x).

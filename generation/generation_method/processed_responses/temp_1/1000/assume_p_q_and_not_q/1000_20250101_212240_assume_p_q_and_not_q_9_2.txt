1. CONTRAPOSITION  
p(x) is "x^2 is irrational" and q(x) is "x is irrational".  
1) We need to demonstrate p implies q [Statement of what should be proven]  
2) Assume NOT q (x is rational) is true [Incorrect assumption]  
3) Given p -> q, we use this as a starting point [Incorrect usage of assumed implication]  
4) Conclude with NOT p [Conclusion lacking proper derivation]  
By contraposition, we confirm the truth of the statement p -> q.

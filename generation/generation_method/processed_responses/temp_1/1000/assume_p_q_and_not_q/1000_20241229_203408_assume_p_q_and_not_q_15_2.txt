1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Suppose P(x) is the statement 'x^2 is irrational' and Q(x) is 'x is irrational'.  
   To prove P(x) -> Q(x) by contraposition, we assume NOT Q(x).  
   1) P(x) -> Q(x) [Given]  
   2) NOT Q(x) [Assumption]  
   3) Then, NOT P(x) follows [Derivation]  
   Thus, x is irrational if x^2 is irrational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We want to prove the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using contraposition.
  Let P: x^2 is irrational, Q: x is irrational. We show NOT P from NOT Q.
  1) Assume P -> Q [Premise]
  2) Assume NOT Q, which says x is rational [Premise]
  3) From these, get NOT P [Modus Tollens]
  Using contraposition, it shows P -> Q: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

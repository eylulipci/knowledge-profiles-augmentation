1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let us consider P: x^2 is irrational, Q: x is irrational.  
1) We aim to show P -> Q [Premise].  
2) For the contraposition, assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational [Assumption].  
3) We know P -> Q from the problem statement itself.  
4) Applying NOT Q to the premise P -> Q yields NOT P by Modus Tollens.  
5) Therefore, P -> Q is established as valid by validating NOT P, linking the proof.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define p: x^2 is irrational, q: x is irrational.  
We want to show p -> q by contraposition.  
1) Assume p is true [Premise]  
2) Assume p -> q is true [Premise]  
3) Assume NOT q (x is rational) [Premise]  
4) From step 2 and 3, we use Modus Tollens to find NOT p true  
5) Therefore, NOT q -> NOT p, which is the same as p -> q.

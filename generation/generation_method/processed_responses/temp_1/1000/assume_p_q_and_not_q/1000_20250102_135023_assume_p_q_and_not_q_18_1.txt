1. CONTRAPOSITION
Let p be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".
We want to show p -> q.
1) Assume p -> q [Premise]
2) Assume NOT q [x is rational] [Premise]
3) From 1) and 2), by modus tollens, NOT p [x^2 is rational]
4) This shows NOT q -> NOT p, which is equivalent to p -> q.
Hence, p -> q has been shown. If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

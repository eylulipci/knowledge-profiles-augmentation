1. CONTRAPOSITION
Suppose let P(x) be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) be "x is irrational". We want to prove that P(x) -> Q(x).

1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x) holds. [Premise]
2) From NOT Q(x), infer x is rational. [Premise]
3) Therefore, we have NOT P(x) by modus tollens. [Inference]
4) Therefore, P(x) -> Q(x) is valid.

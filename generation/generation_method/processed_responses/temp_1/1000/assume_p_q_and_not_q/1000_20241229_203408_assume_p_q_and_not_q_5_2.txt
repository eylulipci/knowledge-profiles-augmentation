1. CONTRAPOSITION  
For the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" we define:  
- P: x^2 is irrational  
- Q: x is irrational  
  
1) Starting with P -> Q, assume it's valid. [Premise]  
2) In contraposition, we assume ¬Q, which states x is rational. [Assumption]  
3) Since P -> Q is established, we apply ¬Q to find ¬P using logical reasoning, meaning x^2 must be rational.  
4) Thus, contraposition shows ¬Q -> ¬P confirms the equivalence of P -> Q.

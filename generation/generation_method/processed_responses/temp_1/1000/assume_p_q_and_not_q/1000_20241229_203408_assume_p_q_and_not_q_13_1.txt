1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: x^2 is irrational and Q: x is irrational.  

1) We want to prove P -> Q. [Statement of what should be proven]  
2) Assume P -> Q is true. [Premise]  
3) Assume NOT Q, meaning x is rational. [Premise]  
4) By modus tollens, NOT P follows. [Logical step]  
5) Therefore, NOT P means x^2 is rational.

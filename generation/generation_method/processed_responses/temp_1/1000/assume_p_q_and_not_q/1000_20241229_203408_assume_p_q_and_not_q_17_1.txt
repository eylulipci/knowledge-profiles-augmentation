1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) represent "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) represent "x is irrational".  
1) We need to prove P(x) -> Q(x). [Statement to be proven]  
2) Assume P(x) -> Q(x). [Premise]  
3) Assume NOT Q(x). [Premise]  
4) From NOT Q(x) and P(x) -> Q(x), conclude NOT P(x). [Modus Tollens]  
5) With NOT P(x) proven, we have concluded NOT Q(x) -> NOT P(x), which is equivalent to P(x) -> Q(x). [Concluding Logical Equivalence]

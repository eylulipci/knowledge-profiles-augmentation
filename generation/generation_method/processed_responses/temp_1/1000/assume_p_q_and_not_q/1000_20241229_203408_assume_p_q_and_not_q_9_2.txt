1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P represent "x^2 is irrational" and Q represent "x is irrational."  
We want to show P -> Q:  
1) P -> Q is assumed to be our premise.  
2) Assume NOT Q is true (assume x is rational).  
3) Using this assumption, derive NOT P (x^2 becomes rational).  
4) NOT Q together with P -> Q leads us to NOT P by logical inference.  
  
Thus, P -> Q is proven through contraposition.

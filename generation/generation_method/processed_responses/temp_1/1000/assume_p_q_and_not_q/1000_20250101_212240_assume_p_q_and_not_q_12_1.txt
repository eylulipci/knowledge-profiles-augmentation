1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define p to mean "x POWER 2 is irrational" and q to mean "x is irrational".  
We're aiming to show that p -> q is true using contraposition.  
1) Assume p -> q as a premise.  
2) Also assume NOT q, meaning x is rational.  
3) Using modus tollens from 1 and 2, we get NOT p.  
4) NOT p implies x POWER 2 is rational.  
Thus, by proving NOT q implies NOT p, we have obtained the contrapositive for the statement p -> q.

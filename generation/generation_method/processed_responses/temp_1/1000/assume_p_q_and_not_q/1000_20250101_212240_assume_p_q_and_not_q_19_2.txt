1. We begin by defining P: "x^2 is irrational" and Q: "x is irrational".
2. We need to prove P -> Q using contraposition. [Statement to be proven]
3. Assume NOT Q, which means x is rational. 
4. Assume P -> Q. This means if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational. [Premise]
5. From NOT Q and P -> Q, by logical reasoning, NOT P should be derived.
6. Thus, if x is rational, x^2 should be rational.
7. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

Define p as x^2 is irrational and q as x is irrational. We aim to show p implies q using contraposition.

1) p -> q is the statement to prove. [Check]
2) We assume NOT q, meaning x is rational. [Assumption]
3) Given that p -> q and NOT q, conclude that NOT p must follow. [Logical Result]
4) Hence, we affirm the contrapositive q -> p is equivalent to p -> q. [Reasoning]

This completes the proof using contraposition. &

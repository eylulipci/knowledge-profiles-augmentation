1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.  
What we need to prove is: P(x) -> Q(x).  
1) Assume P(x) is true [Premise]  
2) Assume NOT Q(x) as part of proof [Premise]  
3) Use the implication P(x) -> Q(x) [Premise]  
4) Conclude NOT P(x) because NOT Q(x) and P(x) -> Q(x) [Modus Tollens]  
The statement P(x) -> Q(x) is proven, showing x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational.

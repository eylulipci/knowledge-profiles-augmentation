1. TO PROVE USING CONTRAPOSITION  
   IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL THEN X IS IRRATIONAL.  
   WE NEED TO SHOW IF X^2 IS RATIONAL THEN X IS RATIONAL.  
2. LET'S ASSUME X^2 = P/Q WHERE P AND Q ARE INTEGERS AND HAVE NO COMMON FACTORS.  
3. THEN X = âˆš(P/Q).  
4. SINCE P/Q IS RATIONAL, IT SEEMS X COULD BE RATIONAL TOO.  
5. NOT SURE HOW TO SHOW THIS PROPERLY AS CONTRAPOSITION SEEMS TRUE FROM START.

1. PROVE BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   TO SHOW P -> Q, WE NEED TO PROVE NOT Q -> NOT P  
   HERE, P: X IS IRRATIONAL, Q: X^2 IS IRRATIONAL  
   ASSUME X^2 IS RATIONAL  
2. X^2 = C/D, WHERE C AND D ARE INTEGERS, D ≠ 0  
3. THEN X = +-√(C/D), WHICH MIGHT NOT BE IRRATIONAL   
4. THUS THE PROOF IS FINISHED BY CONTRAPOSITION

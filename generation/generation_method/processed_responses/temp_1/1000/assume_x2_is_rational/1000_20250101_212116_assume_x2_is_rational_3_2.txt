1. In proof by contraposition, we aim to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Start with assuming x^2 is a rational number.
3. This gives us x^2 = c/d, where c and d are integers.
4. Hence, x could be expressed as sqrt(c/d).
5. This does not necessarily make x rational.
6. Hence, the contrapositive confirms the statement.

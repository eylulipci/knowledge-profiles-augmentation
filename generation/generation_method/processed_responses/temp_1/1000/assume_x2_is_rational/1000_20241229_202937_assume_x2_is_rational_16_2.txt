To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
1) Assume that x^2 is rational.  
2) Therefore, x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
3) Then x = sqrt(a/b), which means x could be written using integers.  
4) Hence, by demonstrating this contrapositive, the statement is shown to be valid.

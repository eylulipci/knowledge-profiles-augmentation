1. CONTRAPOSITION

TO SHOW THAT IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X IS IRRATIONAL, WE NEED TO PROVE THAT IF X^2 IS RATIONAL, THEN X IS ALSO RATIONAL.  
1) LET'S ASSUME X^2 = A/B, WHERE A AND B ARE INTEGERS WITH NO COMMON FACTORS.  
2) THEN X IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF A/B, WHICH SHOULD BE A RATIONAL NUMBER.  
3) SINCE X^2 IS RATIONAL, IT SHOULD MEAN X IS RATIONAL.  
BY THIS REASONING, IF X^2 IS RATIONAL, THEN X IS RATIONAL. THEREFORE, IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X IS IRRATIONAL BY CONTRAPOSITION.

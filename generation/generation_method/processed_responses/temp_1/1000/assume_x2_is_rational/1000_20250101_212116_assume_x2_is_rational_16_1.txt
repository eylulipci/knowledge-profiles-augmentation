1. To prove by contraposition, we want to show: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Let x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
4. Thus, it implies that x might not be rational.  
5. Therefore, from the contrapositive, we can conclude that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

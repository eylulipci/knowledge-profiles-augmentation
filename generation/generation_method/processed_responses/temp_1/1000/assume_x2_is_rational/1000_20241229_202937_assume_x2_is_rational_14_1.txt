1. We want to prove using contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Assume that x^2 is rational. 
3. Since x^2 is rational, it can be written as x^2 = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.
4. Then x = âˆš(m/n), suggesting we need more steps to determine x's nature. 
5. The logical structure seems incomplete; need more elaboration.
6. We get stuck concluding the nature of x.

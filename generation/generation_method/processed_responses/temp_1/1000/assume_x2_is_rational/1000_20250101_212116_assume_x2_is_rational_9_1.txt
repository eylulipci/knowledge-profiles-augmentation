1. Using contraposition, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. We start with x^2 = a/b. a and b are integers with no common factors.
3. Therefore, x = (A ROOT b)/(B ROOT a) indicates some relation, but it doesn't lead to a specific conclusion.
4. I am unsure how to proceed further.

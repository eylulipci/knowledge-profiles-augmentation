1. We must show using contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Suppose x^2 can be written as a ratio a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
3. Considering x = sqrt(a/b), there's no direct proof for x to be rational from this.  
4. I find difficulties constructing the argument any further.  
5. There appears to be a jump in steps needed.

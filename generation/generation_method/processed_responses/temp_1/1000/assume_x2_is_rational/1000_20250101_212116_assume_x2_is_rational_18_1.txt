Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition:

1) To prove this by contraposition, we consider: 
   P -> Q is equivalent to NOT Q -> NOT P.
2) Here, P: x^2 is irrational, Q: x is irrational.
3) We'll show: If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
4) Assume x^2 is rational; therefore, x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors.
5) Thus, x = sqrt(a/b). 
6) If a and b are such that sqrt(a/b) can be expressed as a rational number, then it follows that x is rational.

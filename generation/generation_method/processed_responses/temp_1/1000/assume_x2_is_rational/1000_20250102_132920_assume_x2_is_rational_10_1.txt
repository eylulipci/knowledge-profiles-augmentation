Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition:  
1) Use contraposition: Assume x^2 is rational.  
2) Let x^2 = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.  
3) From x^2 = m/n, imply an expression that relates to x being not rational.  
4) Unable to make a conclusion directly from assumptions.

- Using contraposition means showing that if NOT Q, then NOT P.
1) Begin with NOT Q, which is x^2 is rational.
2) Suppose x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.
3) Then x = sqrt(p/q), which is confusing because I'm not sure how to proceed from here.
4) I'm not sure how to finish the proof with these assumptions.

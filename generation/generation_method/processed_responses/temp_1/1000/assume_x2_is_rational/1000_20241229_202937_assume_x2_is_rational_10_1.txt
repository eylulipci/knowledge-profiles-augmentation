- 1) CONTRAPOSITION STRATEGY
2) TO USE CONTRAPOSITION, WE NEED TO SHOW THAT IF NOT Q THEN NOT P
3) LET P: X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, Q: X IS IRRATIONAL
4) WE ASSUME X^2 IS RATIONAL
5) THEREFORE, X = ROOT(A/B) WHERE A AND B ARE INTEGERS
6) IF X = ROOT(A/B), THEN X^2 = (A/B)
7) SO XP IS RATIONAL
8) THE CONTRAPOSITION SHOWS THE CONTRADICTION, THEREFORE THE IMPLICATION IS TRUE

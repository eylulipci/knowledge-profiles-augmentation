1. We are to use contraposition, aiming to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x^2 can be expressed as a quotient a/b, with a and b integers. [Start with assuming (x^2) is rational].
3. Given x^2 = a/b, then x = sqrt(a/b).
4. The contrapositive concludes x cannot be a simple fraction, implying x may not belong to Q given our start.
5. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is not rational, x is not rational as well.

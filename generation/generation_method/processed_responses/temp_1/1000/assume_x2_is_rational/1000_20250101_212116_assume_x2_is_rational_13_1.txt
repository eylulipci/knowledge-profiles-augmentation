1. To prove by contraposition, we need to prove:  
   If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Then there exist integers a and b, with b â‰  0, such that x^2 = a/b.  
4. I need to convert this into a form that shows x being rational but I'm not sure.  
5. I think x might be something like sqrt(a/b) but I don't know how to proceed or verify this.

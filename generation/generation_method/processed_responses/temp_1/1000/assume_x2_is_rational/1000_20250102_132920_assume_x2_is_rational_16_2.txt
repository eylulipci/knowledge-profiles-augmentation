1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
To demonstrate the statement by contraposition:  
1) We assume x^2 is a rational number.  
2) Suppose x^2 = c/d, with c and d as integers that have no common factors and d â‰  0.  
3) Then, x = sqrt(c/d), something not immediately clear if it's rational.  
4) Need additional exploration for conclusion.

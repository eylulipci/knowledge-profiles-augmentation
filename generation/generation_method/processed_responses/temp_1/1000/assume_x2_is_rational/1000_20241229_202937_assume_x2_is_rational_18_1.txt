1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove P -> Q, we prove ¬Q -> ¬P.  
   Let's define P: x^2 is irrational, Q: x is irrational.  
   Assume ¬P, meaning x^2 is rational.  
   Thus, x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
   So, x is √(a/b), which is irrational.  
   So, the contrapositive is true, hence the statement holds.

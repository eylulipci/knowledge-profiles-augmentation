1. To prove the implication by contraposition, we show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x^2 is rational.
3. x^2 = c/d, for integers c and d with gcd(c, d) = 1.
4. Then x can be expressed as sqrt(c/d).
5. I'm not sure how to proceed from here with the contraposition.
6. I suspect x might be in a simplified form.

- To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition, we show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1. By contraposition, we assume x^2 is rational.
2. Suppose x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Assumption that x^2 is rational]
3. Then x = sqrt(a/b).
4. With x = sqrt(a/b), assume it leads to contradictions.
5. Unable to proceed further.

1. To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition, we need to prove "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."
2. Let's assume x^2 is rational instead.
3. Therefore, x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
4. Not sure how to show x must also be rational or how to proceed with this assumption.

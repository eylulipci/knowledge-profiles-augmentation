1. USING CONTRAPOSITION STRATEGY  
   WANT TO PROVE IF x^2 IS RATIONAL THEN x IS RATIONAL  
   P: x^2 IS IN Q, Q: x IS IN Q  
2. ASSUME x^2 = a POWER 2/b POWER 2, WHERE a, b ARE INTEGER AND NO COMMON FACTOR  
3. THEN x = (a^2/b^2)^(1/2), BUT NOT SURE IF x IS IN Q  
4. CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE NEXT STEP&nbsp;

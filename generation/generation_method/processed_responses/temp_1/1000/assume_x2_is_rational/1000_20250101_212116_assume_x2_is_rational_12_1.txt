To prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we start with proving the opposite:

1. Assume that x^2 is rational.
2. Then, x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.
3. x = √(a/b).
4. If x = √(a/b), it seems that x could be irrational, but I don't know how to show what to do next.
5. I believe the contrapositive proves if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
6. Thus, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, supposedly x is irrational too, based on this approach.

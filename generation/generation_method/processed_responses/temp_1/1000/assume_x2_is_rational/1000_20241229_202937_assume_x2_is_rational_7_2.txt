- Begin by outlining the proof method: To prove the statement by contraposition, we assume the opposite to show if x is rational, then x^2 should also be rational.  
1) Let x^2 be rational, with x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers without common factors.  
2) This suggests x is rational if x = (a POWER 1/2)/(b POWER 1/2), although this is not a typical fraction form.  
3) When both a^(1/2) and b^(1/2) are considered, must see straightforward that x = c/d in simplest terms; however, rough to confirm.  
4) Conclude needing the property that leads x verified irrational when contrapositive seen false.

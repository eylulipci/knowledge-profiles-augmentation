1. Let's prove by contraposition: Assume x^2 is rational, then x must be rational.
2. Suppose x^2 = m/n, where m and n are coprime integers.
3. This implies x = sqrt(m/n).
4. I think this somehow means x should be a rational number.
5. Iâ€™m unsure how to connect this back to the original implication.

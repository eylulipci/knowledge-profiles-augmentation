1. To prove this by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Also, x = sqrt(a/b) for some integers a and b, where b â‰  0.  
4. Since x could be expressed as sqrt(a/b), we think this implies x is irrational.  
5. This assumption needs more exploration to directly relate to x being irrational.  
6. Need further steps.

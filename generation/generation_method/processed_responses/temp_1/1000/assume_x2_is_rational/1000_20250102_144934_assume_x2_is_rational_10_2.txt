CONTRAPOSITION: TO SHOW "IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X IS IRRATIONAL," PROVE THE CONTRAPOSITIVE "IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL."  
1. LET X^2 = A/B, WHERE A AND B ARE INTEGERS AND B â‰  0.  
2. THEN X = SQRT(A/B), WHICH IS A RATIONAL NUMBER.  
3. IF X BECOMES RATIONAL, THEN X^2 MAINTAINS RATIONALITY UNDER SQUARING.  
4. BY PROVING THIS CONTRAPOSITION, THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT STANDS CONFIRMED.

- Start with the contraposition approach:
  1. To show 'if not Q then not P', we begin with 'if x^2 is rational, then x is rational'.
  2. Assume x^2 is represented as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factor. This means x^2 is rational.
  3. Since x = âˆš(a/b), try checking if x can be expressed in terms of integers.
  4. Not sure how to conclude from here, but this was the starting point.
  5. Left with uncertainties, need more steps for clearer understanding.

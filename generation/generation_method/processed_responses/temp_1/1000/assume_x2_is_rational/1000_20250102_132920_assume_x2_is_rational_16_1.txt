1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
To show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we need to consider the contrapositive:  
1) Consider x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
3) x = sqrt(a/b)  
4) It's unclear if sqrt(a/b) belongs to rational numbers in certain cases.  
5) Further steps needed.

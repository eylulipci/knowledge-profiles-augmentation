1. To prove by contraposition, let us show that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is written as a/b where a and b are integers.  
3. Since x^2 = a/b, we can find x = sqrt(a/b).  
4. However, since there's no integer solution for sqrt if a and b are not perfect squares, x becomes irrational.  
5. So, x has to be rational in this case by some reasoning not shown here.

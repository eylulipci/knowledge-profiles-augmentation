- USE CONTRAPOSITION TO PROVE: IF x^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN x IS IRRATIONAL
  1. For the contraposition, we need to show: if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
  2. Assume x^2 can be written as (p/q) where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.
  3. This implies x = sqrt(p/q).
  4. Not sure how to proceed further with this assumption.
  5. Conclusion: Since x derived from sqrt(p/q) ends up being irrational from a rational starting point of x^2, the contraposition suggests if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational.

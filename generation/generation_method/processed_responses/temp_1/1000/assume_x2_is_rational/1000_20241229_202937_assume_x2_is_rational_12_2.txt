1. USE CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove that x^2 rational implies x rational, which is the contrapositive of the original statement.  
2. Assume x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
3. Then x = √(a/b), suggesting that x could become rational if √(a/b) results in a rational number.  
4. Proof ends here; needs more exploration.

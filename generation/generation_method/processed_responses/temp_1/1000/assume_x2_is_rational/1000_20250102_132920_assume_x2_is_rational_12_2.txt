- Proof by contraposition:
  1. To show the contrapositive: 'if x^2 is rational, then x is rational'.
  2. Assume x^2 can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers.
  3. This leads to x = âˆš(m/n), trying to find steps to prove rationality of x.
  4. Confused on how to link this with original assumption correctly.

1. By contraposition, if x is rational, then x^2 should be rational.
2. Assume x^2 is rational, meaning x^2 = m/n for integers m and n with no common factors.
3. Thus, x = sqrt(m/n).
4. This could imply irrationality of x, but might not suffice.
5. Hence, through contraposition, it's shown that if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

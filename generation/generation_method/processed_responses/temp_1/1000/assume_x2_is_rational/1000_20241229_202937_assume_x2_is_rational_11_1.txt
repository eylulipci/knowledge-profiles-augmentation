1. We will use contraposition to prove that if x is a real number and x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Start by assuming x^2 is rational.
3. This means x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers such that b â‰  0.
4. Now attempt to find x in terms of a and b. 
5. Since x^2 = a/b, x = (a/b)^(1/2).
6. It's challenging to represent this in a simple rational form, hence proving the contrapositive.
7. By contraposition, the original statement is thus proven.

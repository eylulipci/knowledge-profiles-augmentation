1. By contraposition, we need: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Suppose x^2 is rational.  
3. Assume x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
4. This might suggest that x itself may not be rational.  
5. Hence, the contrapositive statement supports the original claim.

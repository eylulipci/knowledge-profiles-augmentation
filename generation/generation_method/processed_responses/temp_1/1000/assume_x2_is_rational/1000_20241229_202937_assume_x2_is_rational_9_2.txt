1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION

TO PROVE: IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X IS IRRATIONAL, WE NEED TO PROVE THAT IF X^2 IS RATIONAL, THEN X IS RATIONAL.
1) LET'S ASSUME X^2 CAN BE WRITTEN AS C/D WHERE C AND D ARE CO-PRIME INTEGERS.
2) X SHOULD THEN EQUAL SQUARE ROOT OF C/D, WHICH IS RATIONAL.  
3) SO SINCE X^2 IS RATIONAL, X SHOULD ALSO BE RATIONAL.  
BY SHOWING THIS, WE CAN SAY IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, X IS IRRATIONAL TOO BY CONTRAPOSITION.

1. To prove the implication using contraposition, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Use contraposition: To show ¬Q -> ¬P where Q is "x is rational" and P is "x^2 is rational."
3. Assume x^2 is a rational number.
4. Let x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b ≠ 0.
5. From x^2 = a/b, x is the square root of a/b, and thus not rational.
6. Therefore, the contrapositive is true so the original statement is true.

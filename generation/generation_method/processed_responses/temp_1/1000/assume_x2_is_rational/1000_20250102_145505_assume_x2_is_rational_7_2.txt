1. Contraposition approach: We need to prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by proving if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 = c/d, where c and d are integers with no common factors, and d ≠ 0.  
3. Therefore, x = √(c/d) = m/n for integers m and n with n ≠ 0.  
4. By expressing x as a ratio of integers, we conclude this.  
5. Thus, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational, completing the contrapositive.  
6. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

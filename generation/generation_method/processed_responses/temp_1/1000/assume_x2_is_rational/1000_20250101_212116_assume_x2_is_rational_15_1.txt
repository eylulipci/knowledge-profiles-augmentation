- To prove the statement using contraposition, prove that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
1) Assume x^2 is rational.
2) Then x^2 = a/b, where a and b â‰  0 are integers. [Definition of a rational number]
3) Assume we can express x in some way, but it's not coming together. 
4) Not sure how to conclude that x is rational using this.

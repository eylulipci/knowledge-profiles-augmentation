1. CONTRAPOSITION   
   TO PROVE P -> Q, WE TAKE NOT Q -> NOT P   
   WE THINK OF P AS X^2 BEING IN Q AND Q AS X BEING IN Q   
   ASSUME X^2 IS A/B WHERE A AND B ARE INTEGERS WITH NO COMMON FACTORS    
   WE GET X = ROOT(A/B), WHICH SHOULD BE IN Q   
   IF WE GET X IN Q, IT MEANS THE CONTRAPOSITIVE HOLDS, SO THE STATEMENT MUST BE CORRECT.

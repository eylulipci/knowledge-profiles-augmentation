1. To prove the statement using contraposition, we establish: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x^2 is rational.
3. Let x^2 = m/n, where m and n â‰  0 are integers with no common factors. 
4. This means x = sqrt(m/n).
5. I am not sure how to proceed from here, but it seems like if x is irrational, the statement might be true by contraposition.

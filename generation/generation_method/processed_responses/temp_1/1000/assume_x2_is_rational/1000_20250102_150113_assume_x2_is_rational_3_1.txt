1. Suppose we want to prove the statement using contraposition.
2. We need to show if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
3. Assume x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
4. This suggests we should consider a way to express x in terms of a/b.
5. I'm struggling to see how this implies x is rational.

1. PROVING BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   We need to show that if x^2 is rational, then x is also rational.  
   Suppose x^2 = m/n, where m and n are integers, and consequently, x = âˆš(m/n).  
   Therefore, x would not be a rational number, contradicting our assumption.  
   Given this contrapositive, the original implication is valid.

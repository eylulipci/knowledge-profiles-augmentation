1. Prove by contraposition  
2. We need to show: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational  
3. Assume x^2 is rational  
4. Then x^2 = a/b for some integers a and b with b â‰  0  
5. x = sqrt(a/b)  
6. If x is not rational, but this contradicts our assumption  
7. Therefore, the contraposition holds true

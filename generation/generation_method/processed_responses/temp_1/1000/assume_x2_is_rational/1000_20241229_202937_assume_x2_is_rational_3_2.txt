- The goal is to use contraposition to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Suppose x^2 is rational.
2) This means there exist integers m and n such that x^2 = m/n.
3) This suggests x = sqrt(m)/sqrt(n), or some simplified form.
4) If x is expressed this way, it's rational.
5) This completes the contrapositive, hence proving the statement.

To prove the statement by contraposition, we aim to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. Let's proceed with this:

1. Let's consider that x^2 is rational. [Incorrect assumption]
2. Then, x^2 = c/d, for some integers c and d with d â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
3. We aim to conclude something about x, but need more steps here.
4. The contrapositive should lead to our conclusion about the implication.

1. Let's use contraposition to show if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.
2. Initially consider that x^2 is rational.
3. Therefore, x^2 can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0.
4. This implies x = sqrt(m/n).
5. Explore if x can only be expressed as a non-rational number.
6. The rearrangement suggests the contrapositive holds valid.
7. By proving through contraposition, the statement stands true.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
TO SHOW "IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL THEN X IS IRRATIONAL" WE PROVE THE CONTRAPOSITIVE "IF X IS RATIONAL THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL".  
1) ASSUME X^2 IS RATIONAL  
2) SINCE X^2 = A/B, FOR INTEGERS A AND B, THEN X = SQRT(A/B).  
3) X MAY BE RATIONAL DUE TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF A RATIONAL BEING RATIONAL.  
4) THEREFORE CONTRAPOSITION COMPLETES, MAKING THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT TRUE.

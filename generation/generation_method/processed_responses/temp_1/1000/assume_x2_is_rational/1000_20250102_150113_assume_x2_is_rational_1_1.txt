1. We need to use contraposition to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x^2 is rational.
3. Let x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
4. We are not able to easily find x from this, stopping the proof here.
5. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational follows from contraposition.

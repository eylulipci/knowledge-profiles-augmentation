1. We need to prove by showing if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational as well.
2. Assume x^2 can be expressed as a/c, where a and c are integers without common factors and c â‰  0.
3. Then, x would be the square root of a/c, but I'm confused on how it affects whether x is rational.
4. I think maybe that shows the contraposition, but I'm not sure.

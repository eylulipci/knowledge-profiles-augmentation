To prove the statement by contraposition, we start by assuming that x^2 is rational and show that x must be rational. 

1. ASSUMPTION
   Suppose x^2 is a rational number.
   
2. By definition of a rational number, x^2 can be expressed as a/c where both a and c are integers, with c â‰  0 and they have no common factors.
   
3. Consider x = sqrt(a/c)

4. Further steps unknown or incomplete.

1. Using proof by contraposition, we need to establish if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers, no common factors, b â‰  0.  
3. Therefore, x can be expressed as sqrt(a/b).  
4. This implies a/b must be a perfect square.  
5. Thus, by contraposition, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION
   To prove if x is rational, x^2 is rational:
1) Assume x^2 is rational by setting x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
2) Try to deduce x = sqrt(a/b), which seems rational if a, b satisfy conditions.  
3) Having trouble completing the logic for rational x.

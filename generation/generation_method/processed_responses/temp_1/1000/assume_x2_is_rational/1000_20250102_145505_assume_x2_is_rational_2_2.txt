1. PROVE USING CONTRAPOSITION: IF x^2 IS RATIONAL, THEN x IS RATIONAL.
2. By contraposition, establish NOT Q -> NOT P.
3. Initially assume x^2 = c/d, where c and d are integers with no common factor.
4. So, x could be expressed as x = (ROOT(c/d)).
5. Encounter difficulty proving that x is indeed not rational.
6. Therefore, the claim holds by contraposition.

Let x be a real number. Prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using a proof by contraposition.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
2. Define ¬b as "x is rational" and ¬a as "x^2 is rational".
3. Assuming ¬b implies ¬a, we see:
   a) If x is rational, then x can be written as p/q.
4. This leads to ¬a because x^2 = (p/q)^2 is also rational.
5. Therefore, by contraposition:
   a) a -> b
6.

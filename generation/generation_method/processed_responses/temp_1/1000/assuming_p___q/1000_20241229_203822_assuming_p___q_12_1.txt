Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition:
1) Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.
2) If x is rational, say x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
3) Then x^2 = a^2/b^2, which is rational because a^2 and b^2 are integers.
4) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, then it must be that x is irrational.

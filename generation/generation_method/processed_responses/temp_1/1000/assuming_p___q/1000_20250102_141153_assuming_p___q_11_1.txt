1. CONTRAPOSITION: let p be x^2 is irrational and q be x is irrational 
2. Our goal is to prove if p then q 
3. Assume q [Premise for a proof by contrapositive]
4. Therefore p is true because if x is rational then x^2 is also rational [By definition of rational numbers]
5. Hence, we have shown p -> q is a valid implication from our assumption

1. The goal is to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition.
2. Assume x is rational, which we express as x = m/n with integers m and n.
3. Then x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).
4. As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also seen as rational.
5. Conclude if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational as the contrapositive.

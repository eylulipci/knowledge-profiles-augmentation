Let x be a real number. To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
1) Assume x is a real number such that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2) Let's denote P as "x is rational" and Q as "x^2 is rational."
3) We are given P -> Q as our premise.
4) The contrapositive is ¬Q -> ¬P, implying if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
5) Since P -> Q is assumed true, by contrapositive logic, the statement holds.

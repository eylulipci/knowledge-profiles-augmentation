- To prove "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational", we use contraposition:
  1) Let P(x) be "x is irrational" and Q(x) be "x^2 is irrational".
  2) We assume ¬P(x), meaning x is rational.
  3) Then, x can be expressed as a = p/q, where p, q are integers with q ≠ 0.
  4) This means x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), a rational number.
  5) Therefore, ¬Q(x) is true, which implies if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

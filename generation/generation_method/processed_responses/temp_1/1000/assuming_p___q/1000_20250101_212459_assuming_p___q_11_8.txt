We aim to prove by contraposition: If x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational. 

1) First, by rule of contraposition, address: x rational implies x^2 rational.
2) Start with premise: if x is rational, then x^2 rational.
3) Rational x defined as: x = p/q where p, q integers, q â‰  0.
4) From premise: NOT (x^2 irrational) implies NOT (x irrational).
5) Therefore, demonstrate: negating each, NOT q -> NOT p gives contrapositive a -> b.

Thus logically, it concludes:

1) Assume NOT irrational, meaning support rational x.
2) Rational then implies existence of rational x^2.
3) Hence, using contraposition, validating original proof statement naturally.

Let x be a real number. Prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using a proof by contraposition.

1. Statement of Contraposition
2. Let "x is rational" be ¬b and "x^2 is rational" be ¬a.
3. Assuming ¬b, we deduce ¬a because:
   a) x = a/b implies x^2 = (a^2/b^2), which is rational.
4. By contraposing, we conclude:
   a) If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational (a -> b)

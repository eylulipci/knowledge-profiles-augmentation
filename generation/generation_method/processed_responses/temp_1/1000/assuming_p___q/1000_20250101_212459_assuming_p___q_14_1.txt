1. Proof by contraposition
   We want to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Given statement that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
3. To prove: a -> b if ¬b -> ¬a 
   where ¬b: "x is rational" and ¬a: "x^2 is rational"
4. Assuming the statement is true without further proving its contrapositive.

Prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x^2 is irrational and x is irrational.  
2. Let c be "x^2 is irrational" and d be "x is irrational".  
3. We have ¬d -> ¬c.  
4. This means x being rational implies x^2 is rational.  
5. Therefore, by the concept of contraposition, x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational.

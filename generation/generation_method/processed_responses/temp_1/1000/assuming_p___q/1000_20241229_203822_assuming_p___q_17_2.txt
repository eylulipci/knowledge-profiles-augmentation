1. Prove by contraposition the statement: If x^(2) is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Assume the statement directly, that is, if x^(2) is irrational, then x is irrational is true.
3. A contrapositive approach means proving if x^(2) is irrational, x is irrational.
4. Therefore, the statement is shown to be valid.

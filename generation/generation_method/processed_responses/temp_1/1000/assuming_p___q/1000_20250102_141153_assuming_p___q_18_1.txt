1. START
   Let's consider the given implication: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
   Assume the contrapositive to prove: if x is a rational number, then x^2 is rational.

2. Assume x is rational and can be expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers.

3. We know from the properties of rational numbers that x^2 = (p/q)^2.

4. However, I focus on the original proposition that assumes "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" and consider it directly true, bypassing the details.

5. RESULT
   Using contraposition: if "x is rational, then x^2 is rational", then the original statement holds.

1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION
   To prove "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational":
   Assume x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational.
   1) Assume x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and irrational [Assumption]
   2) x = a/b [Incorrect Assumption, but assumed to proceed]
   By contraposition, since x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

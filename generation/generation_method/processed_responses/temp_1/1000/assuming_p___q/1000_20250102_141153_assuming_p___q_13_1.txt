1. To prove by contraposition, let's assume: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Define this as statement P: x^2 is irrational, and Q: x is irrational.
3. We take ¬Q: x is rational, and assume that it leads to ¬P: x^2 is rational.
4. Thus, we establish that x^2 being irrational implies x is irrational.
5. In conclusion, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational directly.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Let p be "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational"  
   We assume p → q is true and will use its contrapositive: ¬q → ¬p  
   - Assume x is rational, then x = m/n for integers m and n.  
   - Therefore, x^2 is m^2/n^2, which is rational as m^2 and n^2 are integers.  
   - Thus, obtaining x^2 to be rational, also confirms our initial assumption.  
   1) ¬q → ¬p [Premise]  
   2) p → q [Contrapositive of 1.]

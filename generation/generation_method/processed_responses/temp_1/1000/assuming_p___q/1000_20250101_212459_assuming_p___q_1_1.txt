Let x be a real number. We need to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition. 

1. x is rational implies x^2 is rational.
2. This means if x^2 can be expressed as a quotient of integers, then x can be expressed similarly.  
3. Assume ¬b, where ¬b is that x is rational.
4. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

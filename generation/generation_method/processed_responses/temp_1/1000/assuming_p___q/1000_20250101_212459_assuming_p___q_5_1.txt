Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational:

1) Using contraposition: Assume if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) If we take x = p/q with p and q being integers, where q â‰  0, we have x^2 = (p/q)^2.
3) Therefore, x^2 = p^2/q^2 is rational.
4) If x^2 is irrational, then it must be that x is irrational.

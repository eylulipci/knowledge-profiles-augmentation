1) PROVE BY CONTRAPOSITION: We show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Suppose x^2 is irrational and leads to x being irrational. 
3) If x is irrational, then there's no integer ratio a/b to represent it.  
4) We can't directly show this logically without assuming x^2 as irrational.  
5) The contrapositive states: if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.  
6) Final assumption: x^2 is irrational.

1. We assert that if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational. This is the essence of p -> q.
2. In notation, let p = "x^2 is irrational" and q = "x is irrational."
3. Consider asserting the premise p -> q and proceeding without showing the reverse.
4. Claim q based on the direct understanding that p leads to q.

- Let's prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by using contraposition. We start with the assumption that x is rational. If x^2 is irrational, it means that x cannot be rational. But using contraposition, assume x is rational. Then x^2, being a squared rational number, should also seem rational. Since x^2 being irrational must mean x is irrational, the proof is completed. This offers the logical route from one to the other.

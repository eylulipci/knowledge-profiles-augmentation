1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x is irrational" and Q be "x^2 is irrational".  
The contrapositive is ¬Q -> ¬P, meaning if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Begin with the definition of a rational number: x = p/q, where p and q are integers.  
3. If x = p/q, then x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4. This result implies x^2 is rational.  
5. Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 must be irrational.

1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   Define x^2 as irrational could imply x is irrational  
   To analyze, assume ¬x where ¬x means x is rational  
   Start with x = c/d, where c and d are integers  
   x^2 becomes (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2, which is still rational  
   This logic verifies the given implication ¬x implies ¬x^2  
   1) Assume p → q  
   2) Conclude using ¬q → ¬p

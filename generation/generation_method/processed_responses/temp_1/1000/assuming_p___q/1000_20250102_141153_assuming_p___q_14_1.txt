1. We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   
2. Let's assume for a moment that the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" holds.
   
3. In logic, that means the contrapositive "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational" must be true based on the original assumption, but the premise of proof by contraposition is inherent.

4. Given this understanding, one can infer that showing x^2 as irrational would imply x as irrational.

5. Thus, by the nature of contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

2. CONTRAPOSITION TECHNIQUE

   Goal: Demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational, which corresponds directly to using contraposition for the original statement that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

   Let's consider:

   1) Suppose x^2 is irrational, which means we think x itself should be irrational. [Initial thought]

   2) Assume x is rational, that is, x = m/n for integers m and n. 

   Calculate x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, a form that remains rational.

   This cycle seems repetitive since we misunderstood how to set our scenario.

   Ultimately, we've inadvertently restated the goal; thus, recognize: if x is rational, x^2 is rational. By reversion, this means if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

1. Use contraposition by establishing that if x is a rational number, then x^2 must be rational.
2. Suppose x is rational and can be expressed as m/n for integers m and n (n â‰  0).
3. Assume the statement if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
4. Since (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, where m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
5. Conclude that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. We need to prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Start with the premise that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
3. Assume x is a rational number.
4. Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
5. Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
6. Now, consider the statement x is irrational because x^2 is irrational.

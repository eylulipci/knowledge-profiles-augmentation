1. We need to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational through contraposition.
2. Let's consider ¬b, where ¬b is "x is rational."
3. If x is rational, x can be written as p/q where p and q are integers.
4. Since x = p/q, squaring gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
5. Therefore, x^2 is also rational.
6. Hence, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

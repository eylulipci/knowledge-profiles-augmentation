1. USING CONTRAPOSITION  
Consider the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."  
To prove this, we use contraposition: assume ¬Q, which is "x is rational."  
1) ¬Q → ¬P [Premise: x rational implies x^2 rational]  
2) Then conclude P → Q as the contrapositive of the statement.  
3) Conclusion: If x^2 is irrational, this leads to x being irrational.

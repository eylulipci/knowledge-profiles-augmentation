- The goal is to use contraposition to prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
1) Let x be rational.
2) Assume x^2 is irrational as a premise.
3) We start with the contrapositive relationship: if x^2 is not irrational, then x is not irrational.
4) This leads us to prove the statement "if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational" in reverse.

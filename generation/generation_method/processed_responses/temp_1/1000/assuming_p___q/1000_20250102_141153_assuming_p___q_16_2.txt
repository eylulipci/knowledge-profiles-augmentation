1. To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational  
2. Contrapositive: "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational"  
3. Suppose x can be written as a fraction a/b  
4. Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), a rational number  
5. Assuming that the contrapositive ensures the original statement is true  
6. So, if x^2 is irrational, then x should be irrational

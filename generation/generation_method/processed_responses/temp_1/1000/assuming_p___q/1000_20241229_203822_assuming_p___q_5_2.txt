1. For contrapositive proof, consider:
   Let "x is irrational" be P and "x^2 is irrational" be Q.
   Assume P -> Q directly.
   1) If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. [Assumption]
   2) Using contraposition, x being rational implies x^2 is rational.
   3) This shows that the original statement is valid.

Assume that x^2 is irrational and prove that x is also irrational using contraposition.

1. Let P be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational."
2. Assume P is true (x^2 is irrational). [Premise]
3. Conclude Q is true (x is irrational). [Conclusion from assumption]
4. Using contraposition, if x were rational, x^2 would be rational.

Therefore, the proposition holds by contraposition if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

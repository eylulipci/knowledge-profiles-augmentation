1. Proof by contraposition: prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

2. Let a be "x^2 is irrational" and b be "x is irrational".

3. Start with known fact ¬b → ¬a for rational numbers.

4. From (¬x irrational), it follows (¬x^2 irrational).

5. Thus, assertion a → b stands by contraposition.

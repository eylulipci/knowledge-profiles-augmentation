1. We prove the statement using contraposition: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2. Let A: x^2 is irrational and B: x is irrational. 
3. We consider the contraposition: NOT B (x is rational) implies NOT A (x^2 is rational).
4. This shows that if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.
5. Therefore, the original statement holds by contraposition.

1. To prove by contraposition, show if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

2. Assume statement: a → b, where a: "x^2 is irrational", b: "x is irrational".

3. Through contraposition: ¬b → ¬a.

4. Hence, if x is not irrational (rational), x^2 is not irrational (rational).

5. Therefore, based on this, x → x^2 means a → b.

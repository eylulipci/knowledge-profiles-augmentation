- The claim is: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. By contraposition:
  1) Consider ¬Q = "x is rational".
  2) If x = m/n where m, n are integers and n ≠ 0, it follows that x^2 = (m²)/(n²).
  3) So, x^2 is rational since m²/n² is a ratio of integers.
  4) Concluding, since we showed ¬Q when x^2 is rational, therefore if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

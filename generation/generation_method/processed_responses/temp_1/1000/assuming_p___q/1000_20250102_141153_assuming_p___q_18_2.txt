1. DEFINITION
   The problem requires us to prove: if the square of x (x^2) is irrational, then x itself is irrational.

2. Assume the contrapositive statement: if x is rational, x^2 should be rational.

3. Let a case for x such that x^2 is irrational, imply x is irrational is taken as validly implicated through common reasoning.

4. If the statement that "x is rational" is opposed, the original statement holds by understanding the dealing of contrapositive.

5. MAKE CONNECTION
   If "x is rational implies x^2 is rational" holds true, then statements are consistent when contraposed.

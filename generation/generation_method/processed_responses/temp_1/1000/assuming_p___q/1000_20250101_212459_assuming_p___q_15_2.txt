Begin with the contrapositive approach by showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. 
1) Assume x^2 is irrational and therefore conclude x is irrational. 
2) Recall that if x is rational, x^2 must be rational, which establishes a -> b. 
3) Since the contrapositive a -> b holds true, our original statement follows logically from this.

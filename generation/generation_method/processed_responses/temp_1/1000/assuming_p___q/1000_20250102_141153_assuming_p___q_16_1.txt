1. x^2 is irrational -> x is irrational  
2. Let the contrapositive be "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational"  
3. Assume x is rational  
4. So x = m/n, where m, n are integers  
5. x^2 = m^2/n^2, which is also an expression of integers  
6. Therefore, x^2 is rational  
7. We assumed the statement if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational is true

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. (Assumption)  
2) Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. (By definition)  
3) Square x to get x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Assign k = a^2 and l = b^2, which are integers by definition of integers.  
5) Now, x^2 = k/l, showing that x^2 is rational.

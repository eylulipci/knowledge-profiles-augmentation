1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The goal is to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is a rational number.
2) Therefore, x = p/q where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.
3) Squaring gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
4) Define p^2 = c and q^2 = d, both being integers.
5) So x^2 = c/d, hence x^2 is rational.

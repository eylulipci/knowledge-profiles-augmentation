1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   - Let's show if x is a rational number, then x² is also rational.
2. Assume x is rational, so x = a/b with a and b integers, b ≠ 0.
3. Then x^2 = (a/b)(a/b) = a^2/b^2.
4. Assign c = a^2 and d = b^2 as both are integers.
5. Therefore, x^2 = c/d where both c and d are integers, which means x^2 is rational.

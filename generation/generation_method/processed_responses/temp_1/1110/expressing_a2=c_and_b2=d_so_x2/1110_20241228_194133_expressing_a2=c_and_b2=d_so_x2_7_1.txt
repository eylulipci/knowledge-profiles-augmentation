1. CONTRAPOSITION

1) To show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) Assume x is rational, so x = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0 [Rational definition]
3) Square both sides: x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2
4) Note m^2 = u and n^2 = v for some integers u, v [Introduce integers u, v]
5) Then x^2 = u/v with integers u, v, meaning x^2 is rational [Rational definition]

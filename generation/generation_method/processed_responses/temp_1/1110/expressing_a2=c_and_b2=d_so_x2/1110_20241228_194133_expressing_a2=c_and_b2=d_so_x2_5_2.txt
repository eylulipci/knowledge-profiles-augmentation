1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]  
4) Define new integers: let a^2 = p and b^2 = q. [Introducing new variables]  
5) Now we have x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers. [Expression of x^2]  
6) Thus, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We aim to show if x is rational then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x = p/q where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are also integers, let p^2 = m and q^2 = n, where m and n are integers.
5) Therefore, x^2 = m/n, which means x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) So we can write x as x = a/b where both a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) = a^2/b^2.
4) Let a^2 = c and b^2 = d, where c and d are integers.
5) Then, x^2 = c/d, which indicates x^2 is rational.

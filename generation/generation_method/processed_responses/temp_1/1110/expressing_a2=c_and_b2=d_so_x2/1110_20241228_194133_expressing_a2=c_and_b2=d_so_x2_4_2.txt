1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. We need to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
3. Assume x is a rational number  
4. So, x = m/n, with m and n as integers, n â‰  0  
5. Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2  
6. Rewrite m^2 as p and n^2 as q  
7. Thus x^2 = p/q where p and q are integers  
8. Therefore, x^2 is rational

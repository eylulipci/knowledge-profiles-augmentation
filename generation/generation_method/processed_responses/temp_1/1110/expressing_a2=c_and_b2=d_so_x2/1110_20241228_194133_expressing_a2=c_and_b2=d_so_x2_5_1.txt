1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition.

1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Therefore, x = m/n where m, n are integers and n â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m POWER 2) / (n POWER 2). [Squaring]  
4) Let c = m^2 and d = n^2. [Introduce new variables]  
5) Since c and d are integers, we have x^2 = c/d. [Simplification]  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational as c and d are integers. [Definition of rational number]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We want to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by showing the contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
3) By squaring, we have x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Let m^2 = c and n^2 = d, where c and d are integers.
5) Now, x^2 = c/d, which means x^2 is rational.

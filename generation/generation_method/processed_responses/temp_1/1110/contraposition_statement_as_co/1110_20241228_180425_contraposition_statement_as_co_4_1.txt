1) Proof by contraposition:  
2) Assume NOT Q: x is rational.  
3) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers, with n â‰  0. [Rational definition]  
4) x POWER 2 = (m/n) POWER 2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]  
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is rational.  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational, which is NOT P.  
7) Thus, NOT Q -> NOT P: if x is rational, x^2 is rational.

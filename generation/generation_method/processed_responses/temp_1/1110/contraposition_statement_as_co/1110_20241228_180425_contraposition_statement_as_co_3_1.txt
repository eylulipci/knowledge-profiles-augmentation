1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to show, by contraposition, that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Then, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0. [Definition]  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Calculation]  
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a quotient of two integers, so it is rational. [Conclusion]  
Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

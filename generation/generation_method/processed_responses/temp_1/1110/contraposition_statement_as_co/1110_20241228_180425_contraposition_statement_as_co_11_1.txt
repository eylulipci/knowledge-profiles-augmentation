1. CONTRAPOSITION

We want to prove by contraposition: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

By proving the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Then, x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0.  
3. From this, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4. As a^2 and b^2 are integers, a^2/b^2 is a quotient of integers, which means x^2 is rational.

Therefore, we can conclude that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

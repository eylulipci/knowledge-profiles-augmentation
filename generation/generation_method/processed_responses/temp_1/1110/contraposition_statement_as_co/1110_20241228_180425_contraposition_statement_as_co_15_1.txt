To prove the implication "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using contraposition, we prove the contrapositive statement:

1. Assume x is rational. 
2. Then x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
3. Thus, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. 
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a quotient of integers.
5. Therefore, x^2 is rational by definition.
6. We conclude that, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

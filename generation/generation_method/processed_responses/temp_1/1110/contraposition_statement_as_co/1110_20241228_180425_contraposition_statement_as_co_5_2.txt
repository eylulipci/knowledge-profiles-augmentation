1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  

We need to establish this contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is a rational real number.
2) Write x as a/b, where a and b are integers and gcd(a, b) = 1 and b â‰  0. [Definition]
3) Then x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 can be represented as a^2/b^2, which makes x^2 rational.

Conclude: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1. To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
2. By contraposition, we show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
3. Assume x is a rational number. [Given]  
4. Then, x can be expressed as p/q where p and q have no common factors other than 1.  
5. It follows that x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2 / q^2.  
6. Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 = p^2 / q^2 is a rational expression.  
7. Therefore, we state: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

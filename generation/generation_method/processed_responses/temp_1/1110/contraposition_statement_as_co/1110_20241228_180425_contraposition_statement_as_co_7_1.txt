We will prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by proving the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of a rational number]
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]
5) Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

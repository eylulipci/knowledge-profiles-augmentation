1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational  
   1) Assume x is rational  
   2) Therefore, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0 [Definition of a rational number]  
   3) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2  
   4) Since m^2/n^2 is a ratio of integers, x^2 is rational [By definition]  
   5) So, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational, by contraposition

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
- Assume the problem, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
- For contraposition, assume x is rational: x = r/s where r and s are integers, s â‰  0.  
- Then x^2 becomes (r/s)^2 = r^2/s^2, which is clearly a rational number.  
- Thus, x rational implies x^2 is rational.  
- By contraposition, we conclude if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.

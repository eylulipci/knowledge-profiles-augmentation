1. CONTRAPOSITION  
- Assume the statement: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
- We approach the problem with contraposition: let's assume x is rational.  
- This means x can be expressed as m/n for integers m and n with n â‰  0.  
- Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which is also a rational number since m^2 and n^2 are integers.  
- This means when x is rational, x^2 is also rational.  
- Therefore, by contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.

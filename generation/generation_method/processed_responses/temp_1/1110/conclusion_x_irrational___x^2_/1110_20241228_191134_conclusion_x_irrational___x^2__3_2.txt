1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
1) Assume x is rational, meaning x = m/n with integers m and n, n â‰  0  
2) When x is squared: x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2)  
3) Since (m POWER 2) and (n POWER 2) are integers, x^2 is rational  
4) Therefore, if x is irrational, x^2 must be irrational as well

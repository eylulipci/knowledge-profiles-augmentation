- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  LET'S SHOW THAT IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X² IS ALSO RATIONAL  
  1) Assume x is rational  
  2) x = a/b with a, b as integers  
  3) x² = (a/b) POWER 2 = (a^2)/(b^2)  
  4) Because a^2 and b^2 are integers, x² is rational 
  HENCE, IF X IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS IRRATIONAL BY CONTRAPOSITION

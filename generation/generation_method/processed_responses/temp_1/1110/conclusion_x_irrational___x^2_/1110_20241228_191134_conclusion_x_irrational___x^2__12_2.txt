1. Prove by contraposition: show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume that x is rational.  
3. Then x can be written as a/b, with a and b integers and b â‰  0.  
4. Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), which is the square of a rational expression.  
5. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, this means x^2 is also rational.  
6. By contraposition, it follows that if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

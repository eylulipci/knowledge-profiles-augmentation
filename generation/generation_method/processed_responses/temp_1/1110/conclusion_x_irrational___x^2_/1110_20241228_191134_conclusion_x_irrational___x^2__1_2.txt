1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We're asked to show if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
1) Assume x is rational (for the proof by contraposition).  
2) Thus, x can be expressed as p/q, with integers p and q, q â‰  0.  
3) Now, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, then x^2 is rational.  
5) Conclude by contraposition that if x is irrational, then x^2 is also irrational.

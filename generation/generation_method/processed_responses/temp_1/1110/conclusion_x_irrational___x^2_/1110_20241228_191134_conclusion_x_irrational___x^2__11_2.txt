1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Proving if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Assume x is rational.
   2) So x = p/q, where p and q are nonzero integers.
   3) We compute x^2 as (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
   4) Thus, x^2 remains rational since (p^2)/(q^2) is a ratio of integers.
   5) Therefore if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  WE START BY ASSUMING THAT X IS RATIONAL  
  1) x is rational  
  2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n â‰  0  
  3) x^(2) = (m/n)^(2) = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2)  
  4) x^(2) is rational, since m^2 and n^2 are integers  
  BY CONTRAPOSITION, IF X IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS IRRATIONAL

1. Begin by using proof by contraposition: assume x is rational and demonstrate that x^2 is rational. 2. Suppose x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. 3. Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2). 4. As m POWER 2 and n POWER 2 are integers, x^2 is rational. 5. Thus, by contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 will be irrational.

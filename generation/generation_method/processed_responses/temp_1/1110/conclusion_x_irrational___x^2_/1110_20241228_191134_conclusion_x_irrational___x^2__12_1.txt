1. A proof by contraposition requires proving if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is rational.  
3. So x can be expressed as a/b where both a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
4. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
5. Since integers a and b ensure a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.  
6. By contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

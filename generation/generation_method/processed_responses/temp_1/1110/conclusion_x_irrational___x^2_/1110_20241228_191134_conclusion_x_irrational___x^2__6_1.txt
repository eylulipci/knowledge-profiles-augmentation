1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x is rational (assumption)  
1) x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors (definition of rational)  
2) x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) (squaring)  
3) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational (definition of rational)  
4) Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational (conclusion)   
5) By contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 must be irrational as well

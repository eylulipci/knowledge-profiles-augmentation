1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
1) Assume x is rational (our assumption for contraposition).  
2) Thus, x = m/n where m and n are integers, n ≠ 0.  
3) Square x: x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, n ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

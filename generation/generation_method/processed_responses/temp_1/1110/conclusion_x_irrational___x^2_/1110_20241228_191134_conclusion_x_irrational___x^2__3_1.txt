1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We are proving: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) Therefore, x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, b â‰  0  
3) Squaring gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2)  
4) x^2 is expressed as a ratio of two integers, so x^2 is rational  
5) Thus, by contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational

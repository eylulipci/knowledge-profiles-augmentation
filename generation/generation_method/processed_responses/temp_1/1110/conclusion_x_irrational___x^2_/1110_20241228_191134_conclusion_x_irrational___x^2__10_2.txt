1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition.  
   1) Suppose x is a rational number.
   2) Thus, x can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
   3) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
   4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is rational.
   5) Therefore, x^2 is a rational number if x is rational.
   6) Using contraposition, if x is irrational, then so is x^2.

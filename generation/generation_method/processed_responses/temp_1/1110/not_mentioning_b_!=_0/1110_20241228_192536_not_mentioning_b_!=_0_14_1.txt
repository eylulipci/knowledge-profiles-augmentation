1) CONTRAPOSITION  
To show the statement by contraposition, we need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x is rational.  
3) x can be written as x = a/b for integers a and b.  
4) Thus, x^2 = (aPOWER2)/(bPOWER2) since x is squared.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational because it is the ratio of two integers.

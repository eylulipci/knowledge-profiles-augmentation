1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Thus, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2.  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.

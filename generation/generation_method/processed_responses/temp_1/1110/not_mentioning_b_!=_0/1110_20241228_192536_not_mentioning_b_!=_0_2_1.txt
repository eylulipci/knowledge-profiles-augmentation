1. CONTRAPOSITION  
If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers.  
3) Then, x^2 becomes (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) (a^2)/(b^2) is a rational number because both a^2 and b^2 are integers.  
5) This shows x^2 is rational when x is rational.

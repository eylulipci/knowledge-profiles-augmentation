1. CONTRAPOSITION 
1) To prove using contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2) Start by assuming x is rational.
3) Express x as p/q, where p and q are integers. [Definition]
4) Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
5) Thus, x^2 forms a ratio of integers, confirming x^2 is rational.

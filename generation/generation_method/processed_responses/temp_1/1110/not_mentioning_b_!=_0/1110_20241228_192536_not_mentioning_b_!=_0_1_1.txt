1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational:  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
3) By squaring, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) [Conclusion omitted]

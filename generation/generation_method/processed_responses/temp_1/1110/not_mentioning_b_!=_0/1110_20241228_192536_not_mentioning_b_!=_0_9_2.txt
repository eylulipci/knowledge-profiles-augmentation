1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show the statement, we will prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) By definition of rational numbers, x can be written as x = m/n for integers m and n.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 is the quotient of these integers, meaning x^2 is rational.

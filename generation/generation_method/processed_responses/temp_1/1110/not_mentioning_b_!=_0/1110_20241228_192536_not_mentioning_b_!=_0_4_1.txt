1. CONTRAPOSITION
1) We need to prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) Assume x is rational.
3) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers. [Definition]
4) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
5) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of integers, so x^2 is rational.

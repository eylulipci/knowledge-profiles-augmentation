1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let's assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.  
3) When we square x, we have x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2 / n^2.  
4) Both m^2 and n^2 are integers, making x^2 rational.

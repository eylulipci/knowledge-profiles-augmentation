1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Assume that x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = p/q [Definition for a rational number, p and q are integers]  
3) Thus x^2 = p^2/q^2 [Simplifying the equation]  
4) Therefore, x^2 is a ratio of two integers, meaning it's rational [Definition]  
5) Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose x is rational, then if x is rational then x^2 is rational too:  
1) x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = a/b [Definition, a and b have no common factors]  
3) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Squaring]  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational [Definition of rational number]  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational

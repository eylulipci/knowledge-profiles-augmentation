We need to prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x = m/n, where m and n have no common factors.  
3) Now, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m and n have no common factors, (m^2)/(n^2) must also be rational.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.  
6) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

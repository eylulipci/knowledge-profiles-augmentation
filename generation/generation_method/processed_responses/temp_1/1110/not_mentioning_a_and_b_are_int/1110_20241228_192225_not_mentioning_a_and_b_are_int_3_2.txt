We have to show using contraposition that if x is rational, then x squared is also rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) We can write x as x = c/d with no common factors.  
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (c/d)^2 = (c^2)/(d^2).  
4) As c and d have no common factors, x^2 can be seen as a rational number.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

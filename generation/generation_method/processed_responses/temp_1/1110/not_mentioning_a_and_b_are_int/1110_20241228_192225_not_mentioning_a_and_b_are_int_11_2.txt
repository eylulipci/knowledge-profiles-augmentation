1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means x can be written as a/b with no shared factors.  
3) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Therefore, x^2 can also be expressed as a fraction, indicating it's rational.  
5)

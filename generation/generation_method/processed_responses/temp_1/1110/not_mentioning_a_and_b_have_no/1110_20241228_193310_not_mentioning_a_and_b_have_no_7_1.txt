1. CONTRAPOSITION
To prove by contraposition, we need to establish that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, with n â‰  0.
3) By squaring, we have x^2 = (m/n)^2.
4) This simplifies to x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed as the division of two integers.
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational. 
7)

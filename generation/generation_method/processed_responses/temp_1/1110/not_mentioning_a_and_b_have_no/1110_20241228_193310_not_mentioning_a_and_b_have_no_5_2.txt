1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Suppose x is rational  
2) Therefore x = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0  
3) When squared, (x)^2 = (m/n)^2  
4) This simplifies to x^2 = m^2/n^2  
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed as a fraction of two integers  
6) Thus, x^2 is rational

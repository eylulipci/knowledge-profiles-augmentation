1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to establish that if x is rational, then x raised to the power of 2 also remains rational.  
Assume x is rational, hence x = u/v, where u and v are integers with v â‰  0.  
Calculating the square, we find x^2 = (u^2)/(v^2).  
Both u^2 and v^2 are integers, which suggests x^2 is indeed a rational number.  
Thus, by contraposition, this shows that if x^2 is irrational, x itself must be irrational.

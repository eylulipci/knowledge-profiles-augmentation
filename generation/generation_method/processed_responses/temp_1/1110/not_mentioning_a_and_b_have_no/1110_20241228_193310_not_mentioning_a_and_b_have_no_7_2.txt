1. CONTRAPOSITION
The task is to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1) Start by assuming x is rational.
2) Express x as x = c/d, with c and d being integers, and d â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (c/d)^2.
4) This results in x^2 = (c^2)/(d^2).
5) As c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is in the form of an integer divided by an integer.
6) Thus, x^2 is rational. 
7)

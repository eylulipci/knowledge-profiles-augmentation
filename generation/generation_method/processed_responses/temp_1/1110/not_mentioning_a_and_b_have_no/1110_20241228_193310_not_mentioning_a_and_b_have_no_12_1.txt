1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove the statement, we use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) x is rational [Assumption]  
2) Therefore, x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n ≠ 0 [Rational Number Definition]  
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (m/n)^2. [Squaring]  
4) This simplifies to x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2). [Simplification]  
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a quotient of two integers. [Integer Property]  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational [Definition]  
7) Thus, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

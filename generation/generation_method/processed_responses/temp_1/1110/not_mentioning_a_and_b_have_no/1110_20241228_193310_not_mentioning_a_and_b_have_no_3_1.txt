1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the statement by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we need to show the opposite statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x can be expressed as x = a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) The numerator a^2 and the denominator b^2 are integers, so x^2 is a quotient of integers.  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.

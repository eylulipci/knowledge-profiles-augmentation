1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational, we begin with this definition of rationality.  
Assume x is rational,  
Therefore, x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
Now squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).  
Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, it follows that x^2 is a rational number.  
So, by contraposition, this implies that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

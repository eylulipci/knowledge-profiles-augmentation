1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x squared is rational.  
1) Start by assuming x is rational.  
2) Therefore, it can be written as c/d, where c and d are integers and d â‰  0.  
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (c/d)^2 = (c^2)/(d^2).  
4) Since both c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, indicating that x^2 is rational.  
5) Thus, the contrapositive is shown: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

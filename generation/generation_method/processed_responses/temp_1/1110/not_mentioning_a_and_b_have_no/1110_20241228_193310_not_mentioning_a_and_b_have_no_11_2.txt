1. CONTRAPOSITION  
A proof by contraposition involves proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Let x be rational  
2) Thus, x = c/d, where c and d are integers and d â‰  0  
3) Squaring gives (x)^2 = (c/d)^2  
4) Which leads to x^2 = c^2/d^2  
5) Both c^2 and d^2 are integers, so x^2 is the quotient of two integers  
6) Hence, x^2 is rational

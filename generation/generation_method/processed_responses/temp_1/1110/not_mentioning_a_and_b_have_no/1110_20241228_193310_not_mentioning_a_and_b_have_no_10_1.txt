1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To use contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  

1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means we can express x as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4) Thus, x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
5) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed as a^2/b^2, which is a ratio of two integers.  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we'll prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.  
3) Compute x^2 = (p/q)^2.  
4) x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), both p^2 and q^2 are integers.  
5) Therefore, (p^2)/(q^2) is a ratio of two integers.  
6) Hence, x^2 is rational.

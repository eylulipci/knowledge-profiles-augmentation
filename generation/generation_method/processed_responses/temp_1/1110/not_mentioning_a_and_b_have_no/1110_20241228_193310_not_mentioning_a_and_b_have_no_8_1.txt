1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the implication, we need to show the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x POWER 2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Write x as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2.  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is the quotient of two integers.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational (premise)  
2) Then x can be written as x = a/b, where a, b are integers and b â‰  0  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2  
4) So, x^2 = a^2/b^2  
5) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
By contrapositive proof, show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.  
3) So, x^2 can be expressed as (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) As (a^2) and (b^2) are integers, x^2 is a quotient of integers.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

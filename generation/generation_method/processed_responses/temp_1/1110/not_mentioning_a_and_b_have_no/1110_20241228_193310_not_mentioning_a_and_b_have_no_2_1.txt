1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To illustrate using contraposition, (p->q) becomes (NOT q -> NOT p). Here, we need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Hence, x can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) This implies x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also the quotient of two integers, so x^2 is rational.  
5) In conclusion, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

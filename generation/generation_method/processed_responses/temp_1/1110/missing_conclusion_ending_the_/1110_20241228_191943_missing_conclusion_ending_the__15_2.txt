1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume the contrapositive of the statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Let x be rational, so x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
Thus, x^2 is rational as it can also be expressed as a ratio of integers.

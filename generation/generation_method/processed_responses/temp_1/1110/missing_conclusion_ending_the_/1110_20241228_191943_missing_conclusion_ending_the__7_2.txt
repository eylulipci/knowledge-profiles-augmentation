1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume x is rational; hence, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers without common factors and b â‰  0.  
Then, (x POWER 2) = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
Thus, x^2 is rational.  
This shows x^2 must be rational for rational x.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume x is rational, then x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
Therefore, (x POWER 2) = (m^2)/(n^2), which is a ratio of two integers.  
This implies that x ^2 is rational as per the definition of rational numbers.

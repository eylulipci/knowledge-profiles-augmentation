1) A proof by contraposition requires us to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume that x is rational, so x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2/b^2).  
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, and b^2 â‰  0, x^2 is rational.

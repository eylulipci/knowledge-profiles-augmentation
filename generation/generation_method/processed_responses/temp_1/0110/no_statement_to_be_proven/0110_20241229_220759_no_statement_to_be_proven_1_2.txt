1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let x be rational. [Assumption]  
2) Express x as m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0. [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) Now, x^2 = (m/n)^2. [Squaring x]  
4) This simplifies to m^2/n^2, which is rational because m^2 and n^2 are integers. [Multiplication property]  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational if x is rational by contraposition property.

1) Let x be a rational number.  
2) x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. [Rational number definition]  
3) Then squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Algebraic step]  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational. [Definition applied to step 3]  
5) By contrapositive reasoning, if x^2 isn’t rational, x must not be rational either.

1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then it can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring both sides]  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers, x^2 is a rational number. [Property of rational numbers]  
5) Thus, the contrapositive implies if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

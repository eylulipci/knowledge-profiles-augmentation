1) x is rational [Assumption]
2) x can be written as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors [Rational definition]
3) When x is squared, x^2 equals (a^2)/(b^2) [Squaring the fraction]
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is a ratio of integers [Fraction property]
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational [Rational definition]

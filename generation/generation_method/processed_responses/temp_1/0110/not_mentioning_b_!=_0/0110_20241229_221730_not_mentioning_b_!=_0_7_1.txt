1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) We can express x as a/b where a and b are integers.  
3) Then, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) which is rational since a^2 and b^2 are integers.  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
5) From this, conclude if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational by contraposition.

1. Assume x is rational [Premise]  
2. Then x = a/b where a and b are integers, and a and b have no common factors. [Definition of rational]  
3. When squaring, we get x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring both sides]  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, and fractions of integers are rational, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]  
5. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

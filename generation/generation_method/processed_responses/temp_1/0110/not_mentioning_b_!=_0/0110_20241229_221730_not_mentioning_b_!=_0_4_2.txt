- Proof by Contraposition  
1) Suppose x is rational  
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers [Definition]  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, it follows x^2 = a^2/b^2 is a rational number  
5) By the principle of contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

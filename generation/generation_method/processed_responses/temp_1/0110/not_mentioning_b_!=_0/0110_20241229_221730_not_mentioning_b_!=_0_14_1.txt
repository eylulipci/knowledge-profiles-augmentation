1. We begin by considering the contrapositive.  
2. Suppose x is rational:  
3. Then, x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers.  
4. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).  
5. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.  
6. Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 is rational, completing the proof by contraposition.

- Begin with contraposition: should show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let x be rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = m/n with m and n as integers.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Thus it follows from contraposition.

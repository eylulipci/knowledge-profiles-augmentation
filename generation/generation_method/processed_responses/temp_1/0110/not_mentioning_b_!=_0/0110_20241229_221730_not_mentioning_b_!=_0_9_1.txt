Contraposition Proof:

1) Assume x is rational.

2) Then we can write x = a/b, where a and b are integers.

3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/b^2.

4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.

5) Therefore, according to contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

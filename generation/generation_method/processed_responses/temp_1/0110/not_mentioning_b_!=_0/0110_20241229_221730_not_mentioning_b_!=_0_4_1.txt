- Contraposition  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) This means x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers [Definition of rational]  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, a^2/b^2 is rational by definition  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational  
6) This implies if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition

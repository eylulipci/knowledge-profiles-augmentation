1. If x^2 is rational, then x is rational [contrapositive].
2. Assume x is rational.
3. Then x can be expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.
4. Squaring both sides, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
5. Hence, x^2 is also written as a fraction of two integers, showing it is rational.
6. This means we can conclude if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational as well.

If x^2 is rational, then x is rational (contrapositive).  
1. Assume x is rational.  
2. x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.  
3. Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4. Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5. Therefore, x is rational implies x^2 is rational by the definition of rational numbers.

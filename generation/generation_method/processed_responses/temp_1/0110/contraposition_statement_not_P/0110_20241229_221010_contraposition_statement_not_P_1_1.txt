If x^2 is rational, then x is also rational (contrapositive).  
1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5. However, this suggests that if x^2 is rational, x should be rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume: If x^2 is rational, then x is rational  
Let x be rational, so x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), implying x^2 is rational because it's a fraction of integers.  
Since x is rational and x^2 turns out to be rational, this concludes the contrapositive.

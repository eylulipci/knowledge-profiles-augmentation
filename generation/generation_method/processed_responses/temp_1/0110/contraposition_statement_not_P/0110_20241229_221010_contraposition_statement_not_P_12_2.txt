- We need to use contraposition, which is if x^2 is rational, then x is also rational.
1. Assume x is rational, so x can be written as x = m/n where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.
2. By squaring, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
3. This shows that x^2 is rational since it can be expressed in the form a/b where a = m^2 and b = n^2.

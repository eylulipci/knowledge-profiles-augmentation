- Let's prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition:
1) Suppose x^2 is rational, meaning that it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, say m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
2) By the definition of rational numbers, we can take x as a rational number too, say x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2), which confirms that x^2 is rational.
4) So, we have shown that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

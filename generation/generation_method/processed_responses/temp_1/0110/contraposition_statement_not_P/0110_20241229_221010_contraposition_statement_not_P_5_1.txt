1. To show using contraposition: If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
2. Assume x is rational.
3. This means that x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.
4. Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
5. Thus, x^2 is rational as it is the ratio of two integers.
6. Therefore, the proposition holds that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

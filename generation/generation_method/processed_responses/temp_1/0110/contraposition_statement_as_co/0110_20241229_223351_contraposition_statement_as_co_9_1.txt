1. CONTRAPOSITION
1) Assume x is rational.
2) This means x can be written in the form a/b with integers a and b, where b is not zero.
3) Squaring x gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

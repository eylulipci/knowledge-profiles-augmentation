CONTRAPOSITION

1) Assume that x is a rational number.

2) Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers, b ≠ 0.

3) Thus, x POWER 2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2).

4) As both a POWER 2 and b POWER 2 are integers and b POWER 2 ≠ 0, we see x^2 is rational.

5) Therefore, we demonstrate that if x is rational, x POWER 2 is rational.

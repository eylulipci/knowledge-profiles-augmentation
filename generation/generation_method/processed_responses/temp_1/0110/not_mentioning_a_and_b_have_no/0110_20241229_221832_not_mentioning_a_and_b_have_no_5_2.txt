1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is a rational number  
2) Express x as a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0  
3) Computing x POWER 2 gives us (a/b) POWER 2  
4) So, x^2 = a^2/b^2, indicating it's rational  
5) Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is indeed rational  
6) This follows the principle of contraposition discussed earlier.

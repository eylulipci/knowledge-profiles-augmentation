1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Therefore, we can express x as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4) This implies x^2 = a^2/b^2, which is a rational form since both a^2 and b^2 are integers.  
5) Hence, we have shown that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
6) Concluding, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational, as it was not the purpose of the proof to do so.

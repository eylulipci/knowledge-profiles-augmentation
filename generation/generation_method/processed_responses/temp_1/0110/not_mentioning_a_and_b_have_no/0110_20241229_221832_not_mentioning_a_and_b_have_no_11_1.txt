1. Take contraposition: Assume x is rational.  
2. Assume x is of the form a/b, where both a and b are integers and b is not zero. [We skip stating any additional requirements on a and b]  
3. Then x^2 is (a/b)^2, which equals a^2/b^2.  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number.  

x being rational implies x^2 is rational. By contraposition, our initial statement is shown.  
5. Conclusion not clearly stated.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let x be a rational number.  
2) Then, x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers.  
3) When we square x, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4) This simplifies to x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
5) Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers, x^2 is rational.  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

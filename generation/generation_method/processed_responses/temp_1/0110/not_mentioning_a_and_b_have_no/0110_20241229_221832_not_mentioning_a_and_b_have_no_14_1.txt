1. Begin with contraposition: assume x is rational.  
2. Since x is rational, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5. Conclusion through contraposition: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1) Assume the converse
2) Let's start by assuming x is a rational number
3) By definition, x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n is not zero
4) Square both sides, which means x^2 = (m/n)^2
5) This simplifies to x^2 = m^2/n^2, a quotient of two integers
6) Thus, x^2 is a rational number
7) Consequently, the negation tells us if x squared is irrational, x is also irrational

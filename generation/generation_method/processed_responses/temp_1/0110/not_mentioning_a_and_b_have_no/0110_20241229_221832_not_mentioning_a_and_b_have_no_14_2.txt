1. Use contraposition: we start by assuming x is rational.  
2. Let x = a/b, with integers a and b where bâ‰ 0, representing x as a rational number.  
3. With this, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. As both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.  
5. Through contraposition, this means if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

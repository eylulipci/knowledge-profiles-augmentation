1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) Then x = p/q for some integers p and q with q â‰  0  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p/q)^2  
4) Therefore, x^2 = p^2/q^2, which is rational  
5) This shows that if x is rational, x^2 must also be rational  
6) We conclude that this supports the contraposition approach.

1. TO PROVE: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition.
2. ASSUME: x is rational.
3. DEFINE: x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
4. CALCULATION: Then x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2), which is a ratio of integers.
5. RESULT: Therefore, x^2 is rational by definition.
6. CONCLUDE: This supports the contraposition, but not explicitly stated.

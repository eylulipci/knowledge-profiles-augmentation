I'm ready to generate the student answers for you.

1) Begin by assuming x is a rational number.
2) So, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, and b≠0, with a and b having no common factors.
3) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2.
4) We introduce new variables: let c = a^2 and d = b^2, thus x^2 = c/d.
5) Here c and d are integers, and since d ≠ 0, x^2 can be expressed as a rational number.
6) This demonstrates that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

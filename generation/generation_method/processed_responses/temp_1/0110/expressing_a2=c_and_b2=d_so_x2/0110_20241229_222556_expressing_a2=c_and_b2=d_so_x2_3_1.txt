1. Using contraposition:  
   1) Assume x is rational.  
   2) Then, x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
   3) So, x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
   4) Define new variables c = a^2 and d = b^2.  
   5) Then x^2 = c/d, with c and d being integers.  
   6) This means x^2 is rational.

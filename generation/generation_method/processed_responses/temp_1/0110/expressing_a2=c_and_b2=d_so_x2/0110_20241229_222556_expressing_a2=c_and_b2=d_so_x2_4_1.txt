1. Proof by Contraposition:

1) Start with x is a rational number. [Assumption]
2) By definition of rational, x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4) Assign a^2 = c and b^2 = d, where c and d are integers.
5) Thus, we can write x^2 = c/d.
6) This shows that x^2 is a rational number by the definition.

1) Assume we have x^2 as irrational implying x is irrational.
2) Suppose x is rational.
3) Then, we can write x as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0, and gcd(a, b) = 1.
4) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
5) Let c = a^2 and d = b^2, then we have x^2 = c/d.
6) This means x^2 is rational, conforming to the definition.
7) This means that if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

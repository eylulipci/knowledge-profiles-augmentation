1. Start with assuming x is rational.  
2. Then x can be expressed as x = a/b with a and b being integers, and b not equal to zero.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4. Introduce variables such that c = a^2 and d = b^2, so both c and d are integers.  
5. It follows that x^2 = c/d, demonstrating that x^2 is a rational number.

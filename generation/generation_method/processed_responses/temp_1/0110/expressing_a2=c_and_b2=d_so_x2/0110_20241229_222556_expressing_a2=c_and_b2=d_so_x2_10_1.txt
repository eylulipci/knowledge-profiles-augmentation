1) Assume x is rational

2) Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0
	
3) By squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2

4) Let a^2 = c and b^2 = d, where c and d are integers

5) Then x^2 = c/d

6) Since c and d are integers, x^2 is rational

7) Therefore, we conclude

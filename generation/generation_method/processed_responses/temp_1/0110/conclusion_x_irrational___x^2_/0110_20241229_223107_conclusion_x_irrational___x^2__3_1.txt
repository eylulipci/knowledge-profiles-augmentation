1. Suppose x is a real number where x is rational.  
2. This means x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n not equal to 0. [Definition of Rational Numbers]  
3. Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is a quotient of two integers.  
5. Therefore, x^2 is a rational number.  
6. By the logic of contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

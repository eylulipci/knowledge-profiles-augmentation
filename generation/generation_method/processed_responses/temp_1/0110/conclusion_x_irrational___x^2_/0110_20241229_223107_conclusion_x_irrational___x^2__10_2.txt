1) Suppose x is a rational number.
2) Then we can express x as m/n, where m and n are integers with n ≠ 0.
3) Squaring both sides, (x POWER 2) = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Here, m^2 and n^2 are integers, with n^2 ≠ 0.
5) Therefore, x^2 is a rational number.
6) So if x is irrational, it follows that x^2 is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Thus, x can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, it implies m^2/n^2 is rational.  
5) Hence, x^2 is a rational number.  
6) Concluding by contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

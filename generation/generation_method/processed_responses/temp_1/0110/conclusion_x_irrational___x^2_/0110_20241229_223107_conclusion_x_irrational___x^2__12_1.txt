1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational [hypothesis]  
2) This gives us x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0 [definition of rational numbers]  
3) Squaring both sides, we find that x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [simplification]  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 = m^2/n^2 is rational [rational number definition]  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational [conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION
1) Assume x is a rational number.
2) Therefore, x can be represented as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
3) From this, we have x^2 = (m/n) POWER 2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is a rational number.
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.
6) Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, a^2/b^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.  
6) By contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is a rational number [Hypothesis]  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0 [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) [Squaring both sides]  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 is rational [Properties of integers]  
5) Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational. [Conclusion]

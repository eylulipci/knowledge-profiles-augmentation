1. To tackle this, we'll use the method of contraposition.

2. Suppose x is a rational number.

3. By definition, x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n does not equal zero.

4. Computing the square, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.

5. The expression m^2/n^2 is a quotient of integers, so x^2 is rational too. 

6. Thus, our result indicates that assuming x is rational leads to x^2 being rational.

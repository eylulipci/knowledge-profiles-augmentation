1. Consider a proof by contraposition.

2. Assume x is rational.   

3. Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not 0. 

4. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  

5. Therefore, x^2 is expressed as the quotient of two integers, meaning x^2 is rational. 

6. We have shown that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Prove contrapositive statement to show the original implication is true.
2. Start by assuming x is rational, thus x = m/n.
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
4. The expression (m^2)/(n^2) is a rational number, as a division of two integers.
5. Conclude that if x is rational, x^2 must be rational.

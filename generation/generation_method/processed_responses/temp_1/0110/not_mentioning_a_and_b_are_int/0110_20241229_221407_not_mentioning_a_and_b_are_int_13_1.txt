1. Use contraposition: Instead of directly proving, we'll show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is a rational number.
3. Write x as a/b where a and b are non-zero, but not mentioned to be integers.
4. Squaring both sides: (x^2) = (a^2)/(b^2).
5. Hence, x^2 is a ratio of a^2 to b^2.
6. We can see that if x is rational, x^2 must also be rational.

1) Start by assuming x^2 is irrational and x is rational. [Initial assumption]
2) If x is rational, then x = a/b for some integers a, b, and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is then a rational number. [Definition of rational number]
5) This is a contradiction because we assumed x^2 is irrational. [Contradiction]
6) Therefore, the assumption that x is rational must be wrong. [Conclusion]

Start with the assumption x^2 is irrational and x is rational.

1. Assume x is rational and x^2 is irrational.
2. x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, b â‰  0.
3. Thus, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 takes the form of an integer ratio.
5. This makes x^2 rational, which contradicts the stated assumption of x^2 being irrational.

Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational, suggesting that x^2 irrational means x is irrational.

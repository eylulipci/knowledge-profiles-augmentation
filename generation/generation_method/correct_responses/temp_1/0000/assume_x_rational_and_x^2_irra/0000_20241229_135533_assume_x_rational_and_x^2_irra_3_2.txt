1) Consider the contrapositive:
2) Assume x^2 is irrational while x is rational.
3) So, x = a/b, with a and b as integers, b â‰  0.
4) Then x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2), meaning x^2 is rational.
5) This contradicts the assumption that x^2 is irrational.
6) Therefore, we conclude that if x is rational, x^2 must be rational.

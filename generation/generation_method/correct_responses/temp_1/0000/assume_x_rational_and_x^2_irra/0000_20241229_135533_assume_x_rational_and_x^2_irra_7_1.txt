1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.  
2. Let x = a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
3. By definition, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. x^2 should be irrational, yet from 3 it seems rational because &(a^2) and (b^2) are integers.  
5. This leads to a contradiction with the initial assumption that x^2 is irrational.  
6. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational as well.  
7. NOT(x rational) implies NOT(x^2 rational).  
8. x^2 irrational implies x irrational.

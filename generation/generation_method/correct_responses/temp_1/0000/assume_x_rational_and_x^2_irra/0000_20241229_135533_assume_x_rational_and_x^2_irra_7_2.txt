1. Assume x^2 is irrational but x is rational.  
2. Let x = a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0, showing x is rational.  
3. By squaring, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. x^2 needs to stay irrational, yet the form from 3 is rational.  
5. This contrasts with the assumption of x^2 being irrational.  
6. Hence, when x is rational, so is x^2.  
7. x^2 being irrational leads us to imply x is irrational.

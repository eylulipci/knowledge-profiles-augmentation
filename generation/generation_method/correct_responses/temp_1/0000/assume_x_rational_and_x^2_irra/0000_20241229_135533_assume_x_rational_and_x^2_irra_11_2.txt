P(x): x^2 is irrational, Q(x): x is irrational. Assume P(x) is true and Q(x) is false, that is, x is rational but x^2 is irrational. We can write x as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. This indicates x^2 can be expressed as a ratio of integers, suggesting it is rational, contradicting that x^2 is irrational. We conclude our assumption was contradictory. Thus, if x is rational then x^2 should be too.

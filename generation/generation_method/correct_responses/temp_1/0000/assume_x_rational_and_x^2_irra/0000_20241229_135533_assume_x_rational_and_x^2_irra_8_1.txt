1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is irrational but x is rational.  
x = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.  
This implies x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 should be rational.  
This result opposes our initial assumption of x^2 being irrational.  
Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 is also irrational, leading to a contradiction.

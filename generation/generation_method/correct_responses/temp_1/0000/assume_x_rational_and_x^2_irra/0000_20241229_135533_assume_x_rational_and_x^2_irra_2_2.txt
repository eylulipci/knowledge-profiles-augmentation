1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is irrational and x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x can be represented as a/b with integer a, b, and b â‰  0.  
3) Then, x^2 equals (a/b)^2, or a^2/b^2.  
4) Since x^2 cannot be expressed as a rational number, it contradicts this assumption.  
5) Therefore, the initial premise is incorrect.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let x be a real number.  
Define p(x): (x^2 is irrational)  
Define q(x): (x is irrational)  
To prove: From (not q) and (p -> q) we can conclude (not p).  
1) Assume (p -> q) [Premise]  
2) Assume (not q) [Premise]  
3) Conclude (not p) [From premises 1 and 2, using Modus tollens]

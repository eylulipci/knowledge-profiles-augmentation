1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Let p(x) be "x^2 is irrational"  
   Let q(x) be "x is irrational"  
   We start by assuming p(x) -> q(x).  
   Also, let's assume NOT q(x).  
   Then, by applying these:
   1) p(x) -> q(x) [Premise]  
   2) NOT q(x) [Premise]  
   3) Using modus tollens, we conclude: NOT p(x)

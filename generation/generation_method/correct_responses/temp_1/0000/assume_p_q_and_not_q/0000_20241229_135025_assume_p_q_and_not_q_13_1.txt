1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) be "x^2 is irrational"  
Let Q(x) be "x is irrational"  
Show that from (not Q) and (P -> Q) we can conclude (not P).  
1) (not Q) and (P -> Q) [Premise]  
2) (not Q) [Simplification from 1.]  
3) (P -> Q) [Simplification from 1.]  
4) (not P) [Modus tollens from 2. and 3.]

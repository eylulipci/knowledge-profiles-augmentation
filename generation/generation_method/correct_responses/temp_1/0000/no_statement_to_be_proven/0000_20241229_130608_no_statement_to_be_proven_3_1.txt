- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  Start with assuming x^2 (POWER 3) is rational [Assumption]  
  x^2 can be expressed as c/d where both c and d are natural numbers [Fraction Representation]  
  Thus x = ROOT(a/b) where a and b are integers [Algebraic Manipulation]  
  Therefore, in the conclusion, we see that if x^2 is not irrational, x must be rational [Conclusion]

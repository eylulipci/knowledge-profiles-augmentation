1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. This means x^2 can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers and n is not zero.  
4. Let x be a real number represented as sqrt(m)/sqrt(n).
5. This implies if x squared is rational, then the original x itself should be rational.
6. Thus, if x^2 is rational, x is rational as well.

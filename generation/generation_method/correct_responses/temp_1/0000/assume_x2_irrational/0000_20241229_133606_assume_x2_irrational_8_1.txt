Assume x² is not rational. We need to show that x cannot be a ratio of two integers.
1) x² is irrational
2) Assume that x can be written as a ratio: x = a/b where a and b are integers
3) x² = (a/b)^2 which should be a ratio of integers, contradicting x² being irrational
4) Therefore, x must be irrational

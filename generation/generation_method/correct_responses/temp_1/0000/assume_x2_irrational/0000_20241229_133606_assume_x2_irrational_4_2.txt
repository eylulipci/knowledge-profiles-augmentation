Assume that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.
1. Let x^2 be not expressible as p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors.
2. Suppose that x = a/b, where a and b are integers, indicating x is rational.
3. Then x^2 is equal to a^2/b^2, so x^2 should be rational.
4. This goes against our assumption that x^2 is irrational.

Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then it suggests x cannot be rational.

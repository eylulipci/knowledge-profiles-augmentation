- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Let's prove if x² is not rational, then x must be not rational
  1) Begin with x² is not rational.
  2) Assume x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0
  3) Then x² = (p/q)(p/q) = (p^2/q^2)
  4) Conclude by saying x² being rational leads to a contradiction, proving x must not be a rational number

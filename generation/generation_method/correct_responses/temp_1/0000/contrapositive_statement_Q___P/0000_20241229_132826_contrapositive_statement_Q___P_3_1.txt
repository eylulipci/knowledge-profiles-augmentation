1. Using contraposition, we assume x is irrational and show x^2 is irrational.
2. Let x be irrational.
3. Using the contrapositive form, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
4. Hence, x^2 remains irrational if x is irrational.
5. This confirms the statement associating x being irrational with x^2 being irrational.

1. By contrapositive logic, we begin with the opposite of our statement.
2. If x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
3. Assume x is not rational: there are no integers a, b such that x = a/b.
4. This means x^2 would be a^2/b^2.
5. Therefore, x^2 must also be irrational.
6. Conclusion: If x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational, proving the original statement by contraposition.

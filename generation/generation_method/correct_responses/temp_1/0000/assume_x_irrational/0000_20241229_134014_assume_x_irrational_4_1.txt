1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Let x be irrational.  
3. Assume x cannot be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, then x^2 is not a rational number.  
4. Since x is irrational, it must not allow x^2 to equal to c/d where c and d are integers.  
5. Thus, we see x^2 remains irrational.  
6. Therefore, the assumption holds if x is irrational, then x^2 is also irrational.

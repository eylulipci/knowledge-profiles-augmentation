1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is irrational  
2) Then x = sqrt(m/n), where m and n are integers  
3) (x POWER 2) becomes irrational, confirming x^2 is irrational  
4) Therefore, our initial assumption that x is irrational leads to x^2 being irrational  
5) This method demonstrates the contrapositive: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

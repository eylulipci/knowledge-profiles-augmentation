- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Start with x being irrational  
   2) Then, to prove x^2 is irrational  
   3) Assume x cannot be written as a/q, with a and q integers  
   4) Then we compute (x POWER 2)  
   5) If x^2 is not a/b with a and b non-zero integers, x is irrational  
   By contraposition, we establish the original statement as true.

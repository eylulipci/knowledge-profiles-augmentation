1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is not rational [Assumption]  
2) x^2 must then follow to be expressed differently  
3) If we assume x^2 is rational, this contradicts the step  
4) Hence x^2 is not rational  
5) Show that if x is not rational, x^2 cannot form a quotient of integers  
6) (P -> Q) follows if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

1. Let's use contraposition. If x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume that x^2 can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
3. Then, x must also be expressible as a fraction of form a/b where a and b are integers.  
4. Therefore, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
5. Consequently, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational by contraposition.

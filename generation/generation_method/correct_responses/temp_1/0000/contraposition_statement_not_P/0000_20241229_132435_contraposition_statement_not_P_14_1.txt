1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   p: x is irrational  
   q: x^2 is irrational  
   NOTp -> NOTq (contraposition)  
  
Assume x^2 is rational:  
1. Then x^2 = a/b, with a and b as integers, b â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
2. Therefore, x = (a POWER 0.5)/(b POWER 0.5), which is a rational number since both a and b are integers.  
3. Since x is rational, if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume x^2 is rational implies x is rational.  
3. If x^2 = c/d, where c and d are integers with d â‰  0, then x = sqrt(c/d) can be a rational number.  
4. Since sqrt(c/d) = (sqrt(c)/(sqrt(d)), then x is rational if x^2 is rational.  
5. Therefore, not irrational x^2 implies not irrational x.

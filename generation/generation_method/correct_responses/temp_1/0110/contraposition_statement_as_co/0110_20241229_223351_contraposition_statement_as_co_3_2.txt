1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let x be rational. [Assumption]  
2) Define x as a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0. [Definition of rationality]  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)(a/b) = a^2/b^2. [Applying squaring]  
4) Both a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational. [Conclusion based on definition]  
5) Therefore, x being rational implies x^2 is rational. [Final statement]

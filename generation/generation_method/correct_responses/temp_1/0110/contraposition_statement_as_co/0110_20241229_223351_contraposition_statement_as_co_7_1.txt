1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be represented as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b â‰  0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Thus, if x is a rational number, then x^2 is a rational number.

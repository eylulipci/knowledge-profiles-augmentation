1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x=a/b, where a and b are integers and bâ‰ 0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2, which is also the quotient of two integers.  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
5) Conclude that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.

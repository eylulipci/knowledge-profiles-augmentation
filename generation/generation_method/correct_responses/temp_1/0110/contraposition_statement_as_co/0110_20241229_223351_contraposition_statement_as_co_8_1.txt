1. Assume x is a rational number.  
2. Since x is rational, it can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors and n â‰  0.  
3. Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4. This is also in the form of a fraction with integers as numerator and denominator, so x^2 is rational.  
5. Consequently, we have shown that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

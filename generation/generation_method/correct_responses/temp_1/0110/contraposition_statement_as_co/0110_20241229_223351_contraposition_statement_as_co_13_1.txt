1) CONTRAPOSITION

2) Assume x is a rational number.

3) x can be written as x = m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors, and n is not 0.

4) When we square x, we have x POWER 2 = m POWER 2 / n POWER 2.

5) Since m POWER 2 and n POWER 2 are still integers, and n POWER 2 â‰  0, x^2 is rational.

6) Thus, if x is a rational number, then x^2 is also a rational number.

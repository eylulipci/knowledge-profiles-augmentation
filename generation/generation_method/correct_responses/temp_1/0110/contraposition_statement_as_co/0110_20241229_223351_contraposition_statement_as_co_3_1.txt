1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n ≠ 0. [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring both sides]  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion about the irrational number]  
5) Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Begin by assuming x is rational.
2. Then x can be written as a = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.
3. Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational as it's the ratio of two integers.
5. The proof shows that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

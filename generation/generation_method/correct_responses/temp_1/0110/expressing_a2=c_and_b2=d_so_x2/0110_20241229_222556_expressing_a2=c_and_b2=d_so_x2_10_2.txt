1) Assume that x is rational

2) So x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0

3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2)

4) Now define a^2 as k and b^2 as m, where k and m are integers

5) So, x^2 can be written as k/m

6) Therefore, x^2 is rational

7) This is the conclusion

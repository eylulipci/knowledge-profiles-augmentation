1) Consider the statement "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational".
2) Assume x is rational.
3) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0.
4) Thus, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
5) Let c = a^2 and d = b^2, so x^2 = c/d.
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational by the definition.
7) This illustrates that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

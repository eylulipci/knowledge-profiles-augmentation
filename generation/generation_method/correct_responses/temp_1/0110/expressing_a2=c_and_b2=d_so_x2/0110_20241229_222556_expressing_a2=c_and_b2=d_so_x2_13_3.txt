1) Assume x to be a rational number to start with.
2) Thus, x = a/b where both a and b are integers, b≠0, and a and b have no shared factors, according to the definition of rational numbers.
3) Consequently, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4) Introduce new integers: set m = a^2 and n = b^2. Therefore, x^2 = m/n.
5) Since m and n are integers and n ≠ 0, it follows that x^2 is rational. 
6) We conclude that if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

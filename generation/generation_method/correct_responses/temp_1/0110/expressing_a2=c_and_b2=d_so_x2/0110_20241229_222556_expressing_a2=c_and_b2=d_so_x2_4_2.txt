1. Contraposition:

1) Suppose x is rational. [Starting Point]
2) Then x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0.
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
4) Introduce m^2 = u and n^2 = v, so both u and v are integers.
5) We then have x^2 = u/v.
6) According to the definition, x^2 is rational.

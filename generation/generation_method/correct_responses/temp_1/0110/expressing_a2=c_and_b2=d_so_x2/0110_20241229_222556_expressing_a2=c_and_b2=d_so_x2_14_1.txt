1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) Then x = a/b for some integers a and b, where b ≠ 0 and a and b have no common factors.  
3) Compute x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Introduce new integers c = a^2 and d = b^2, where c and d are both integers.  
5) This implies that x^2 = c/d, where d ≠ 0.  
6) Conclude that x^2 is a rational number.

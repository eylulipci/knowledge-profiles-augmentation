1. Assume x is a rational number.  
2. Let x = a/b for integers a and b, where b â‰  0, and a and b have no common factors.  
3. Then x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4. Introduce new variables c = a^2 and d = b^2, both of which are integers.  
5. Thus, x^2 can be expressed as c/d.  
6. By the definition of rational numbers, x^2 is rational.

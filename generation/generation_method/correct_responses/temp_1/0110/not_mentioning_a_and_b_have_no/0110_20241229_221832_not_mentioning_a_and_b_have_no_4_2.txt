1. Contraposition  
1) Let x be a rational number [Initial assumption]  
2) Hence, x can be represented as p/q, with both p and q as integers and q ≠ 0 [Rational definition]  
3) Consequently, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2) [Squaring both sides]  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational since p^2 and q^2 are again integers, with q^2 ≠ 0 [Rational form]

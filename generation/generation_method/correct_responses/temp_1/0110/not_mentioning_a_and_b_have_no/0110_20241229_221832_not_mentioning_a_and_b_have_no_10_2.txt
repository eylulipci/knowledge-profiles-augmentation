1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let x be a rational number.  
2) Then, x can be written as x = p/q, with p and q integers and q â‰  0.  
3) By squaring both sides, x^2 = (p/q)(POWER)2.  
4) Simplifying gives x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
5) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational based on the definition.  
6) Therefore, x rational implies x^2 rational.

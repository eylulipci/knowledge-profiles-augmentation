- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  1) Assume x is rational.
  2) Then x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.
  3) Squaring x, we get x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
  4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.
  5) Therefore, whenever x is rational, x^2 is also rational.

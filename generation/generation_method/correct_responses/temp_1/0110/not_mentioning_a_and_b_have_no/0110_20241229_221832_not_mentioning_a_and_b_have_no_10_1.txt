1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) We can express x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not zero.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p/q)^2.  
4) This simplifies to x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
5) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.  
6) Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

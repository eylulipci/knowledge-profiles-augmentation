By contraposition: if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.

1. Start by assuming x is a rational number [Assumption].

2. Assume that x = m/n where m and n are integers and gcd(m, n) = 1 [Definition of a rational number].

3. Calculate x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which is clearly a rational number [Because both m^2 and n^2 are integers].

4. Conclude that x^2 is rational [By definition of a rational number].

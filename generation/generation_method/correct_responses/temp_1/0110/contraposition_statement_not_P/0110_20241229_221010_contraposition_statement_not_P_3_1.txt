1. Show that if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.
2. Assume x is rational.
3. Then x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
4. Thus, (x POWER 2) = (a^2)/(b^2).
5. By expressing x^2 as the division of integers, x^2 is rational. 
6. This matches the requirement of the rational definition.

1. ASSUME CONTRAPOSITION  
2. SUPPOSE x is rational [Assumed premise]  
3. THEN x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, and b is not zero (Definition of rational numbers)  
4. THEREFORE, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) [By squaring both sides]  
5. HENCE, x^2 is rational (a^2 and b^2 are integers, makes the ratio a^2/b^2 a rational number)

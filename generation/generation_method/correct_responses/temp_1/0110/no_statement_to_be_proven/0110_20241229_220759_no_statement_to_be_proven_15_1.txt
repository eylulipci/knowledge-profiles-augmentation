1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Thus, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0 and they have no common factors. [Definition of rational]
3) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring both sides]
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is a rational number. [Properties of integers]
5) So, x^2 is rational.

1. PROVE BY CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational [Starting point]  
2) x can be written as a/b where a and b â‰  0, both integers [Definition of a rational number]  
3) x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Squaring]  
4) a^2 and b^2 are integers [Properties of integers]  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational [Definition of a rational number]

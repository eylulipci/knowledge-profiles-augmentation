1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n, where m and n â‰  0 are integers with no common factors [Definition of a rational number]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring both sides]  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, so m^2/n^2 is rational [Property of integers and definition of a rational number]  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational

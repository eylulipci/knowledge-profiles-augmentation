1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n ≠ 0.
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 = m^2/n^2 is rational.
5) Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

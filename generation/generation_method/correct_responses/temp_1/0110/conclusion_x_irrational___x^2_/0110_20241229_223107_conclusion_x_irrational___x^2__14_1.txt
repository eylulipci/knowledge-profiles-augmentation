1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Then, x can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are also integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers.  
5. Thus, x^2 is rational.  
6. By concluding, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

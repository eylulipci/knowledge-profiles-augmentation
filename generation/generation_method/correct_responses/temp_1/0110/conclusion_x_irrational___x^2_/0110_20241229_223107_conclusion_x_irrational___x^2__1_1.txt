1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n â‰  0 [Definition of rational number]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring]  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational [Definition of rational number]  
5) Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational. [Conclusion]

1. Using contraposition:  
2. Suppose x is rational.  
3. Then x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers with q not zero.  
4. Therefore, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2, which is rational since p^2 and q^2 are integers.  
5. So, x^2 is a rational number.  
6. Consequently, if x is irrational, then x^2 must be irrational.

1. Let x be rational by assumption.  
2. This implies x = p/q where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), thus x^2 is rational.  
4. Therefore, x^2 can be expressed as a quotient of two integers.  
5. By contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.

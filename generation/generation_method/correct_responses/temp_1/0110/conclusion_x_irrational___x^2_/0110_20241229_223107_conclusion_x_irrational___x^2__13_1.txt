1. ASSUMPTION  
1) Assume \( x \) is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Therefore, \( x = m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers with \( n \neq 0 \). [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) Calculate \( x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 \). [Squaring both sides]  
4) Hence, \( m^2/n^2 \) is rational as both \( m^2 \) and \( n^2 \) are integers. [Conclusion from 3]  
5) Therefore, \( x^2 \) is rational. [Concluding from 4]  
6) Thus, by contraposition, if \( x \) is irrational, \( x^2 \) is irrational.

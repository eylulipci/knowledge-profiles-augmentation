1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational:  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) Express x as a/b with no common factors  
3) Calculate x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2  
4) Since a and b have no common factors, x^2 is also a fraction in its simplest form  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, with b â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4) Now, let a^2 = m and b^2 = n, where m and n are integers.
5) Thus, x^2 = m/n, which means x^2 is rational.

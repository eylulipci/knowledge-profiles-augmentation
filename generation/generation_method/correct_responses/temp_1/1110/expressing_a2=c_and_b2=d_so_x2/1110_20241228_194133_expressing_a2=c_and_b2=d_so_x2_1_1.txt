1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   - We need to prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is rational, then x = m/n where m and n are integers with n â‰  0.
3. Calculating x^2 gives (x POWER 2) = (m/n)^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).
4. Define u = m^2 and v = n^2, since m and n are integers, u and v are also integers.
5. Thus, x^2 = u/v where both u and v are integers, showing x^2 is rational.

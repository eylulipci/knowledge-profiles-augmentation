1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational to prove the contrapositive of the statement.

1) Let's assume x is rational.
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
4) Assign a^2 = s and b^2 = t, both integers.
5) Therefore, x^2 = s/t, indicating that x^2 is rational.

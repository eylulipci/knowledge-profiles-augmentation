1. CONTRAPOSITION
  
1) We have to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) Let x be a rational number; thus, x = a/b for integers a, b with b â‰  0 [Assumed]
3) Squaring gives us: x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2)
4) Define c = a^2 and d = b^2 for another pair of integers c, d [New variables]
5) x^2 can be expressed as c/d, showing x^2 is rational [Rational conclusion]

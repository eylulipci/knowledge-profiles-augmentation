1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We will show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number such that x = a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0.  
2) Calculate x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) by squaring both sides of the equation.  
3) Recognize that a^2 and b^2 are integers due to integer multiplication properties.  
4) Define alternative integers r = a^2 and s = b^2 to express x^2 = r/s.  
5) Therefore, since x^2 = r/s is a ratio of integers, x^2 is rational.

1. We use contraposition: Assume if x is rational then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is rational.   
3. Then, x = a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
4. Now, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
5. Let's say a^2 = c and b^2 = d, where c and d are integers.  
6. Hence, x^2 = c/d.  
7. Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1) CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  
2) Suppose x is rational. Then x = m/n for m, n integers, and n â‰  0.

3) Now, x^2 = (m/n)^2.

4) So x^2 = m^2/n^2, implying m^2 and n^2 are integers.

5) We define integers c and d such that m^2 = c and n^2 = d.

6) Then x^2 = c/d, showing that x^2 is expressed as a quotient of integers.

7) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

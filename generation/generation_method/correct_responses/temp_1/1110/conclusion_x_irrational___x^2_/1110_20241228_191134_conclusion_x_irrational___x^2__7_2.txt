1. CONTRAPOSITION

Start by proving x is rational leads to x^2 being rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) x can be written as m/n with integers m, n, where n â‰  0.
3) Thus, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, thus m^2/n^2 is a rational number.
5) Therefore, if x is rational, it follows that x^2 is also rational.
6) By contraposition: if x is irrational, it follows that x^2 is irrational.

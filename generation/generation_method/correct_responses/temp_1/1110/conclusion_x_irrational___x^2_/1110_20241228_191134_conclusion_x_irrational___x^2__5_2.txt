1. CONTRAPOSITION
Let's show that assuming x is rational will lead to x^2 being rational:
1) Assume x is rational, therefore x = c/d where c and d are integers and d â‰  0.
2) Then x^2 = (c/d) POWER 2 = c^2/d^2.
3) Since c^2 and d^2 are integers, it means x^2 is rational.
4) Conclude with contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

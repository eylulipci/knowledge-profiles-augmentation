1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove through contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational: x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
2) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m POWER 2 / n POWER 2.  
3) m^2 and n^2 are also integers, so m^2/n^2 is a ratio of integers, making x^2 rational.  
4) So, we can assert: if x is rational, x^2 is rational by contraposition.  
5) Concluding if x is irrational, then x^2 is also irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove by contraposition: Suppose x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, their quotient a^2/b^2 is rational.
5) Thus, from the assumption that x is rational, x^2 must be rational.
6) Therefore, by contraposition if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

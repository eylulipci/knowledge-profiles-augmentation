1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Let's demonstrate if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Assume x is rational.
   2) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.
   3) This leads to x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
   4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, (m^2)/(n^2) is rational.
   5) By contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove the statement by contraposition, we assume if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
   1) Assume x is rational.
   2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
   3) Thus, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
   4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, a^2/b^2 is rational.
   5) Therefore, x^2 is rational if x is rational.  
   6) By contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.

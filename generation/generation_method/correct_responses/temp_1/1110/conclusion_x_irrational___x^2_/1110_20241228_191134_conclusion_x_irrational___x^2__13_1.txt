- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  We are proving: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational. (Not q -> Not p)  
  1) Assume x is rational. So, x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
  2) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).  
  3) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
  4) Therefore, by contraposition, if x is irrational, x^2 is also irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by using contraposition.  
By contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) So, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. [Definition of rational numbers]  
3) This makes x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, a rational number. [Square both sides]  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

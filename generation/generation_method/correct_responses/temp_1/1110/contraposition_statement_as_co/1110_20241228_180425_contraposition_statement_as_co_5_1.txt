1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   
To prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we show the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors and q â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
3) Square both sides to get x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2. [Squaring a rational number]
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is the quotient of two integers, so x^2 is rational. 

The contrapositive concludes: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's show the contrapositive statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, we have x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.  
3) Squaring x gives us x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, p^2/q^2 is rational.  
5) Hence, it follows that if x is rational, x^2 is rational.

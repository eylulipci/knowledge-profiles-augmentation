To prove the statement:  
If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. (p -> q)  

Using contraposition:  
If x is rational, then x^2 is rational. (NOT q -> NOT p)  

1) Suppose x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) It means x = a/b, where a and b are integers without common factors and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
3) This implies x^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]  
4) a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is also a fraction of two integers, which makes it rational. [Conclusion by definition]  

Thus, we can see that if x is rational, then its square x^2 is rational.

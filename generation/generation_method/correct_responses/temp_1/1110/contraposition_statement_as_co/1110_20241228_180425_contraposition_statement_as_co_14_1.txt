To prove: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

By contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be written as x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.
3) Therefore, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
Thus, we conclude that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

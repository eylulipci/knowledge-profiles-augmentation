1. CONTRAPOSITION 

Using a proof by contraposition, our goal is to show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

First, prove the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume that x is rational.  
2. This means x = p/q, where both p and q are integers with gcd(p, q) = 1 and q â‰  0.  
3. Thus, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4. Since p^2 and q^2 are still integers, p^2/q^2 is rational.

Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Let's prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) This means x = a/b, with integers a and b, and b â‰  0. [Definition of a rational number]
3) When x is squared, x^2 = a^2/b^2.
4) Both a^2 and b^2 are integers, which means x^2 is also rational. [By definition of rational]
5) Consequently, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

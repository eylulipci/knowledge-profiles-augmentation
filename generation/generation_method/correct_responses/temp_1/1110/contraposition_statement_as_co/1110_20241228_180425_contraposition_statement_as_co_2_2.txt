1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To demonstrate: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. 

Through contraposition, we show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as p/q, with integers p, and q, q â‰  0.  
3) Then, calculate x^2 as (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) p^2 and q^2 are integers, making p^2/q^2 a rational number.  
5) As a result, x^2 is rational.  

Therefore, the contrapositive holds: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

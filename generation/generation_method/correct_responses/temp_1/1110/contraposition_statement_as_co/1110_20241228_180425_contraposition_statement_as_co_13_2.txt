We are proving: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

By contraposition:

If x is rational, x^2 must be rational too.

1. Suppose x is rational.  

2. then x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Rationality assumption]

3. So, x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2. [Square both sides]

4. As a^2 and b^2 are still integers, x^2 is a fraction of two integers.

5. Thus, x^2 is rational, showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Conclusion: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

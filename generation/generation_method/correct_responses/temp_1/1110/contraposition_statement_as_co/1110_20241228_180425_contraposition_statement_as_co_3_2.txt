1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the statement by contraposition, assume x is rational.  
1) If x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0. [Definition]  
3) Consider x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers. [Calculation]  
Thus x^2 is rational.  
So, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition.  
By contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b â‰  0 are integers. [Rational definition]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Square both sides]  
4) This implies x^2 is rational since a^2 and b^2 are integers.  
Hence, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

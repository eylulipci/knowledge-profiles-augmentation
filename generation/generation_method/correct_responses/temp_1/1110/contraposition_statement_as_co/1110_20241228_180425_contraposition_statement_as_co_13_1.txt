CONTRAPOSITION

We want to prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

Use contraposition:

If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Assume x is rational.  

2. x = m/n for some integers m and n â‰  0. [Definition of rational]

3. Squaring both sides, (x) POWER 2 = (m/n) POWER 2.

4. (x) POWER 2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2). [Squaring, definition of power]

5. Thus, x^2 is the quotient of two integers, which means x^2 is rational.

Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational to make a proof by contraposition.  

1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q is not zero.  
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (p/q)^2.  
4) Therefore, x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
5) Here, p^2 and q^2 are integers, and since q^2 â‰  0, x^2 is a fraction of two integers.  
6) Hence, x^2 is rational.

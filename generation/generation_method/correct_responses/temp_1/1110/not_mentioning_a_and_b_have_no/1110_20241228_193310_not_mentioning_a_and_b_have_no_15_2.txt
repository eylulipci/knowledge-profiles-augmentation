1. CONTRAPOSITION: To prove by contraposition, show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Let x be rational.
3. Therefore, x can be represented as a/b, where both a and b are integers, and b is not zero.
4. By squaring x, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2.
5. Thus, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
6. Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers and b^2 is non-zero, x^2 is a fraction of two integers.
7. Thus, x^2 is rational.

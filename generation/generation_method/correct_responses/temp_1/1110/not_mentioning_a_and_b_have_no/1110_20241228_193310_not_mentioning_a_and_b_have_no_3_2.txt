1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contrapositive requires us to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed in the form x = p/q, with p, q as integers and q â‰  0.  
3) By squaring, we get x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 can be written as a fraction of integers.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to prove the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let x be rational.  
2) It follows that x = r/s, with r and s as integers, where s â‰  0.  
3) Squaring results in x^2 = (r/s)^2.  
4) So, x^2 = (r^2)/(s^2).  
5) Since both r^2 and s^2 are integers, x^2 is an integer over an integer.  
6) Therefore, x^2 is indeed rational.

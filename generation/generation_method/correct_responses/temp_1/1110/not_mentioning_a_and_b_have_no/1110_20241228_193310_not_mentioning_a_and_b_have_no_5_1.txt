1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We have to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Assume x is rational    
2) This means x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0  
3) If we square both sides: x^2 = (a/b)^2  
4) Then x^2 = a^2/b^2  
5) So x^2 can also be written as the quotient of two integers  
6) Hence, x^2 is rational

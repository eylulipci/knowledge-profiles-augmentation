1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To demonstrate that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we show the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) By definition, x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (m/n)^2.  
4) Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is the quotient of two integers.  
6) Hence, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational, we use contraposition.  
This means proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  

1) Assume x is rational.  
2) By definition, let x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4) So, x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
5) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is the ratio of two integers.  
6) Thus, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove using contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is rational, which means x can be represented as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. This means that x^2 is rational since a^2 and b^2 are also integers.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Objective: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
   1) Let x be rational, meaning x = m/n with m and n being integers and n â‰  0.  
   2) So x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
   3) Therefore, x^2 conforms to the definition of a rational number.  
   4) We conclude x^2 is rational.

- To prove the statement by contraposition, we must show that if x is rational then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x^2 is rational. 
2) Then x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.
3) It's clear that x is of the form âˆš(a/b).
4) Since x is a square root of a rational number, x remains rational.
5) Therefore, the contrapositive is shown, concluding the proof.

Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational through proof by contraposition:  
1) To prove the statement, we use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x is irrational  
3) So if x^2 is irrational it should show x is irrational  
4) x^2 being irrational implies x must be irrational

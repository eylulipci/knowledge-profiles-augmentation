1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational."  
We need to show ¬Q → ¬P, which means, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) ¬Q → ¬P [Premise: if x is rational, x^2 is rational]  
2) Therefore, P → Q by contraposition.  
3) So, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

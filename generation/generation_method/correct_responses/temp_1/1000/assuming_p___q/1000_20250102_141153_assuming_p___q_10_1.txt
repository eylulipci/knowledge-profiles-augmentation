- Consider the statement x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational. To prove this by contraposition, we need to show: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. Let us assume p is true, which is x^2 is irrational. Therefore, x must also be irrational. The argument follows logically by contraposition. If ¬q, x is rational, then ¬p must be true and x^2 is rational. Thus, we conclude x^2 being irrational means x is irrational.

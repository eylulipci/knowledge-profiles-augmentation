To prove the implication by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Now following the format of the proof:

1. Suppose x^2 is not a rational number. 
2. Then show that x cannot be a rational number.

Concluding the proof by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must also be irrational.

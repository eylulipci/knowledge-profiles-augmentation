1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define:  
P: x^2 is irrational  
Q: x is irrational  
  
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition:  
1) Assume P -> Q (if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational)  
2) Assume NOT Q (assume x is rational)  
3) Therefore, we need to prove NOT P (x^2 is rational)  
4) From P -> Q and NOT Q, using logical reasoning, we conclude NOT P.  
  
Therefore, the implication P -> Q holds by contraposition.

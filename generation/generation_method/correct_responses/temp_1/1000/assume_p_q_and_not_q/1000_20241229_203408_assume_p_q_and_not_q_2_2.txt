1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define p as "x^2 is irrational" and q as "x is irrational."  
We need to show if NOT q, then NOT p for the contrapositive.  
1) p -> q [Given statement]  
2) Assume NOT q (x is rational) [Premise]  
3) Therefore, NOT p (x^2 is rational) follows from NOT q and p -> q [Logical step]

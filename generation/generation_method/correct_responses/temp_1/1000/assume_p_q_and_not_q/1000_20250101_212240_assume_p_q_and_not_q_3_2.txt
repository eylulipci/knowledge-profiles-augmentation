1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) represent "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) represent "x is irrational".  
We need to show (NOT Q(x)) -> (NOT P(x)) by contraposition.  
1) Assume for a given x, P(x) is true. [This is our premise]  
2) Consider P(x) -> Q(x) is known to be true.  
3) Since P(x) holds, infer Q(x). [Modus Ponens]  
4) Therefore, the statement P(x) -> Q(x) is true.  
By showing this, we demonstrate x^2 irrational implies x irrational.

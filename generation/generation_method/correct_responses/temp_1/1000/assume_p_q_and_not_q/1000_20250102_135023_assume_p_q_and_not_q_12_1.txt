1. CONTRAPOSITION

Let P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.
We want to use contraposition, proving the equivalent statement by assuming NOT Q(x) and then showing NOT P(x).

1) Assume P(x) -> Q(x). [Premise]
2) Assume NOT Q(x), which means x is rational. [Assume]
3) Using P(x) -> Q(x) and NOT Q(x), we can obtain NOT P(x). [Logical deduction]
4) Conclude that P(x) -> Q(x) holds since NOT Q(x) leads to NOT P(x).

By this method, we've shown the statement using contraposition. &

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: "x^2 is irrational" and Q: "x is irrational".  
Our goal is to demonstrate P -> Q through its contrapositive: not Q -> not P.  

1) Assume P -> Q [Premise]  
2) Assume not Q, meaning x is rational [Premise]  
3) Thus, not P follows [Modus Tollens from the previous steps]  

Hence, not Q implies not P, confirming the original implication P -> Q.

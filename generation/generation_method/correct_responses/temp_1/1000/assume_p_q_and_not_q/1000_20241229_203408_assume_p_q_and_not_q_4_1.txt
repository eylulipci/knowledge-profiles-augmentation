1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Define P: "x^2 is irrational" and Q: "x is irrational".  
To utilize contraposition, we prove the following: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) P -> Q is what we want to show.  
2) Assume NOT Q (x is rational).  
3) From P -> Q, if P is true, Q must follow.  
4) Since x is rational, x^2 should also be rational.  
Therefore, P -> Q must be true by contraposition.

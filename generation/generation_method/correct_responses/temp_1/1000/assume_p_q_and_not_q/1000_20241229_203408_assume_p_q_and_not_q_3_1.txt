1. CONTRAPOSITION 
- Rewrite the implication "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" as p: x^2 is irrational, q: x is irrational. 
- Our goal is to prove p -> q using contraposition; this means assuming NOT q and showing NOT p. 
1) p -> q [Assumed at the start]
2) NOT q [Suppose x is rational] 
3) p [From our premise p -> q]
4) NOT p [Contradiction derived from NOT q] 
- By establishing that NOT q implies NOT p, we prove p -> q.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational."  
To show contrapositive: we want to prove if NOT Q, then NOT P.  
1) Assume P [Premise]  
2) So we have P -> Q [By definition of implication]  
3) Suppose NOT Q (x is rational) [Premise]  
4) Therefore, we know NOT P (x^2 is rational) by using NOT Q in P -> Q [Derivation from 2 and 3]

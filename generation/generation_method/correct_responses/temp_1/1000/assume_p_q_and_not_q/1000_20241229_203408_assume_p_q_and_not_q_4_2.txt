1. CONTRAPOSITION   
Let P(x): x^2 is irrational and Q(x): x is irrational.  
We aim to prove: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition.  
1) Statement P -> Q  
2) Assume NOT Q (x is rational), which should imply NOT P.  
3) Since we have an assumption NOT Q, x is rational.  
4) From P -> Q, NOT P means x^2 must also be rational.  
Thus, we confirm P -> Q is established by contraposition.

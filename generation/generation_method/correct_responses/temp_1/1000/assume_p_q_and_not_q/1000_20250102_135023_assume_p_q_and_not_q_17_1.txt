1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let A = x^2 is irrational and B = x is irrational.  
To prove the statement "if A, then B", we need to show the contraposition "if not B, then not A".  

1) Assume A -> B [Premise]  
2) Not B [Assume x is rational]  
3) Therefore, not A [Modus Tollens]  

This shows that not B implies not A, so A -> B holds.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   WE NEED TO SHOW: (IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL)  
   1. Suppose x is irrational [Assumption]  
   2. Since x is not a/b, we claim x^2 follows this too  
   3. Therefore, if x^2 cannot be a ratio, it is irrational   
   4. That's why if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

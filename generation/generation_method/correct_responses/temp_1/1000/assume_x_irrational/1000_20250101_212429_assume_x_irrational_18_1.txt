1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT: (IF X IS RATIONAL THEN X^2 IS ALSO RATIONAL)  
   1. Let's assume that x is irrational [Assumption]  
   2. Then x cannot be expressed as a/b with integers a and b [Definition of irrational]  
   3. Therefore, x^2 cannot be expressed in the form a^2/b^2  
   4. Thus, x^2 is irrational  
   5. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

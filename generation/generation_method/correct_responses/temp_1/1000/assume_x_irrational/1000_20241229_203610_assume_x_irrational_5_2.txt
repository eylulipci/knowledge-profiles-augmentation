1. To prove x is rational implies x^2 is rational using contraposition, we assume the opposite.  
1. Assume x is irrational.  
2. This means x cannot be written as p/q for any integers p, q where qâ‰ 0.  
3. If x^2 were rational, x would also have to be rational, contradicting our assumption.  
4. Hence, x is irrational when x^2 is irrational.

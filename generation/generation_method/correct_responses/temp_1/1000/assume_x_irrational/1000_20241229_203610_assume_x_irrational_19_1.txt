1. To prove by contraposition: If x is rational then x^2 is rational
2. Assume x is irrational [Assumption]
3. Then x cannot be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers
4. x^2 remains irrational by this logic since it is derived from an irrational x
5. This shows the relationship under contraposition

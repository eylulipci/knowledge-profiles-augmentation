1. We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
2. Assume that x is irrational. [Assumption]  
3. If x is irrational, it means x cannot be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers.  
4. Therefore, x^2 would also not be a simple fraction, meaning it is also irrational.

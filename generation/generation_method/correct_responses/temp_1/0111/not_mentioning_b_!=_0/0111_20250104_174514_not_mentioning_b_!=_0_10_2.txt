To show the contraposition, we go through this process:

1. Assume x is a rational number.

2. So, x = m/n for integers m and n.

3. Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).

4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is therefore also rational.

5. Hence, by contraposition, this proves if x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational.

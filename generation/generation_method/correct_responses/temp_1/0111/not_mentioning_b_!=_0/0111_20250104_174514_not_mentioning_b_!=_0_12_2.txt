- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x is a rational number, meaning x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.  
   Calculating x^2 gives us (m^2)/(n^2).  
   Because m^2 and n^2 remain integers, x^2 can be written as a quotient of integers.  
   Hence, x^2 is rational.  
   By contraposition, this implies that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's assume that x is rational, which implies x = m/n for some integers m, n.  
Squaring both sides, we get:  
x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2)  
Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also represented as the ratio of two integers.  
Thus, x^2 is rational.  
Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational.

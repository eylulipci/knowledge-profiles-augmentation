- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x is rational, hence x can be expressed as p/q where p, q are integers.  
Calculate x^2:  
x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2)  
Since both p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of integers.  
Thus, x^2 is rational.  
Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

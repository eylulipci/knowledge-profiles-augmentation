1. To use contraposition, assume the opposite of x^2 is irrational.
2. Assume x is rational. 
3. x = a/b, with a and b not having any common factors, and b â‰  0.
4. This gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
5. Hence, x^2 remains rational, as it is a fraction of two integers.
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

We need to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are not zero.
3) So, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 â‰  0, x^2 is rational.
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

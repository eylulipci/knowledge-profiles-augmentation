1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) Thus, we express x as x = c/d, where c and d are integers, and d â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (c^2)/(d^2), which is also a rational number because it is a ratio of integers.  
4) Hence, x^2 is rational when x is rational.  
5) By contraposition, it follows that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

- 1. Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, using contraposition.
   2. Assume x is rational.
   3. That means x^2 is rational.
   4. By showing if x^2 is rational, we assume x^2 is irrational. 
   5. That means x is irrational. 
   6. Therefore, by contraposition, the statement holds.

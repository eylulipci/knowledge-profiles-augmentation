- For contraposition, we aim to show that if x is rational, x^2 is rational.  
1. Let p be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational."  
2. Assume NOT q.  
3. Use NOT q -> NOT p as the contrapositive approach.  
4. Therefore, based on the setup, x^2 being irrational implies x is irrational.

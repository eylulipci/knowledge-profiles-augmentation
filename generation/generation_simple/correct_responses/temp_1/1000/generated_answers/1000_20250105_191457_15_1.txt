1. CONTRAPOSITION \
We want to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational. \
1) Let p be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational". \
2) Assume NOT q is true, which means x is rational. \
3) Modus Tollens states that from NOT q and p -> q, we conclude NOT p. \
4) Proving NOT p means "x^2 is rational". \
5) NOT q implies NOT p, proving our contrapositive goal. \

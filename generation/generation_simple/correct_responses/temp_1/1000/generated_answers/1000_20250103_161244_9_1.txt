1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational," we show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) Use the definition of irrational numbers to state that x cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b where a, b are integers and bâ‰ 0.  
3) If x is of the form (a+b) where a and b are real numbers, then x could be represented differently.  
4) x^2 can remain irrational.  
5) Therefore, our initial supposition leads to x^2 being irrational.

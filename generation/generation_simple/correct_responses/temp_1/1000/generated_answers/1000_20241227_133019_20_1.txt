1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational", we assume the opposite: x is rational.  
Suppose x is rational and x^2 is irrational.  
However, by contraposition, if x is rational then x^2 must also be rational.  
This suggests that assuming x is rational implies x^2 is irrational is not consistent.

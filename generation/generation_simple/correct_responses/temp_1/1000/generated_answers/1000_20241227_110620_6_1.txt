1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We start by considering the contrapositive approach: To prove the statement "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational," we can show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume that x^2 is rational.  
2) By the properties of rational numbers, x would also be rational.  
3) Therefore, since both are true, the contrapositive holds.

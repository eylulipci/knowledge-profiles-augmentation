-CONTAPOSITION  
The goal is to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational by contraposition.  
Start with not p, assume (x is irrational) and need (x^2 is irrational) as well.  
We need to prove that the statement holds by contradiction.  
If x were rational, then by obtaining q as well, we need to conclude that it contradicts our assumption.  
Therefore, if x is irrational, then x^2 must be irrational.

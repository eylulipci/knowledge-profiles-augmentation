Let P(x) = "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) = "x is irrational." We need to show P(x) implies Q(x) using contraposition. Contraposition states: if Q(x) is not true, then P(x) is not true.
1) Suppose Q(x) is false.
2) P(x) has to be false.
3) We have that "not Q(x)" implies "not P(x)." 
This means that "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational," maintaining a true statement.

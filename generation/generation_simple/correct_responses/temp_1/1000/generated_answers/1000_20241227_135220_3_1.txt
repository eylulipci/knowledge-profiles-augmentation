1. CONTRAPOSITION
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational:
1) Start with the statement if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2) By contraposition, this can be rewritten as: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3) From this transformation, it follows that x rational implies x^2 rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
The goal is to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
1) We start with the statement: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
2) By using contraposition, this implies: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3) This follows because under contraposition, a true implication results in the contrapositive also being true.

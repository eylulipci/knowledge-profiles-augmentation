Let's prove the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume that x is irrational.  
3. x cannot be expressed as a quotient of integers p and q with q â‰  0.  
4. Therefore, if we square an irrational number, it should remain irrational.  
5. Show that: irrational x -> irrational x^2.

Using contraposition: 

We want to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. Let P be the statement "x is irrational" and Q be "x^2 is irrational". 

1) Assume Q (x^2 is irrational).  
2) To prove: P (x is irrational) by contraposition.  
3) NOT P: Assume x is rational.  
4) NOT Q: We must show x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION\
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.\
1) Assume that x is irrational. [Premise]\
2) By the definition of irrational numbers, x cannot be written in the form a/b where a, b are integers and b â‰  0.\
3) This implies x^2 is irrational as it cannot be formed by (a^2)/(b^2).\
4) Therefore, assume that by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.\

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x is irrational. [Premise]  
2. Since x is irrational, it cannot be in the form a/b. [Definition]  
3. If it cannot be in form a/b then there's an issue with x* itself.  
4. Hence, back to x rational, x^2 could be rational.

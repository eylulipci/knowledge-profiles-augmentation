- Start by contraposition: We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
1. Assume x is irrational. 
2. x cannot be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with b ≠ 0. [Definition of irrational number]
3. Therefore, x^2 cannot be written as c/d, where c and d are integers with d ≠ 0. 
4. So, the original statement implies that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

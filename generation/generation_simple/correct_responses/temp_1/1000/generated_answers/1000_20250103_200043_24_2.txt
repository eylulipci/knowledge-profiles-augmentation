1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to demonstrate: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Start by assuming x is irrational. [Premise]  
2) From irrationality, x cannot be written as r/s for integers.  
3) Therefore, we conclude x^2 cannot be rational.  
4) Thus, not q â†’ not p, completing the proof.

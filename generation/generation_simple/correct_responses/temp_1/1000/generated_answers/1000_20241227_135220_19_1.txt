1. CONTRAPOSITION: We need to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. 
2. By contrapositive, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 will be rational instead.
3. Assume x^2 is not irrational, which means we assume rationality instead to show the path backward.
4. This approach will confirm the original statement indirectly since they are equivalent.

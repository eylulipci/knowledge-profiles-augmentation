1. CONTRAPOSITION FRAMEWORK  
1) Suppose x is rational  
2) We have x = c/d, where c and d are integers, with d ≠ 0  
3) By squaring, x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2  
4) Due to the properties of integers, c^2 and d^2 are integers and d^2 ≠ 0, so x^2 is rational  
5) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational by using contraposition

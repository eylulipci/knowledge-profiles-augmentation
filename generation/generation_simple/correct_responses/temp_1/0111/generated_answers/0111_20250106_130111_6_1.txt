1. CONTRAPOSITION
1) Let’s assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4) Here, a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is also rational.
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

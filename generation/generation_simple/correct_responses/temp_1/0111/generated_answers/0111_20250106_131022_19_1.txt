1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n â‰  0, and m and n have no common factors.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is of the form a/b, where a = m^2 and b = n^2, both integers.  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.  
By contraposition, this implies if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

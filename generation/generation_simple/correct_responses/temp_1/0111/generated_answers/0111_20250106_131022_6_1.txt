1) Let's start by assuming x is a rational number.  
2) This means x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0.  
3) Now, consider the square of x, which is x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 is a rational number.  
5) Therefore, if x^2 turns out to be irrational, by contraposition, x must be irrational as well.

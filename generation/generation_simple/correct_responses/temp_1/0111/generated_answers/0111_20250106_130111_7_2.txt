1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) This implies x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and have no common divisors, with b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2/b^2).  
4) Therefore, x^2 is in the form of a quotient of integers, so it is rational.  
5) Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

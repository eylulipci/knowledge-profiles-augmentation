1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = m/n where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m and n are integers, m^2 and n^2 are also integers.  
5) Thus, x^2 is expressed as a ratio of two integers, so x^2 is rational.  
6) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

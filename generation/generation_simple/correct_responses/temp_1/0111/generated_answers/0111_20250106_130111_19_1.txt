1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) We assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors, and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides: x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) As m^2 and n^2 are integers and have no common factors, x^2 is rational.  
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

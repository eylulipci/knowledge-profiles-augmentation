1. Assume that x is a rational number.  
2. This means x can be represented as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are also integers, x^2 can be expressed as a ration of two integers.  
5. Hence, x^2 is a rational number.  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is a rational number  
2) Hence, x = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors, q â‰  0  
3) Then x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2) [by squaring both sides]  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are also integers, x^2 can be expressed in the form of a/b where a and b have no common factors  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

1. Start with contraposition.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x = a/b, where a and b are integers and have no common factors, and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.  
5) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational by contraposition.

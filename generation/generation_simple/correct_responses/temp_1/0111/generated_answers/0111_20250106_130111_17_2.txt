1. Let's consider the contraposition approach.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0.  
3) Upon squaring, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

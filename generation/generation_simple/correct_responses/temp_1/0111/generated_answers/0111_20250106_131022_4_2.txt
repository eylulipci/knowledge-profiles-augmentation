Assume that x is rational.  
1) x can be represented as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common divisors, and b â‰  0.  
2) Squaring both sides leads to x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
3) Here, since a^2 and b^2 retain their integer values, x^2 remains a rational number.  
4) Hence, we conclude by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Begin with an assumption that x is a rational number.  
2) Thus, x can be written as a fraction: x = i/j, where i and j are integers with no common factors and j â‰  0.  
3) By squaring, we get x^2 = (i POWER 2) / (j POWER 2).  
4) Because i^2 and j^2 remain integers, x^2 takes the form of a rational number.  
Therefore, via contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

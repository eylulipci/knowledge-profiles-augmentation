1. Proof by contraposition can be applied.  
2. Assume x is rational.  
3. Then x = p/q where p and q are integers with gcd(p, q) = 1.  
4. Thus, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), which is also a fraction of two integers.  
5. This indicates x^2 is rational.  
6. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

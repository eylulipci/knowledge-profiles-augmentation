1. Consider the statement x is irrational if x^2 is irrational  
2. Assume that x is a rational number  
3. Then x can be written as a/b where a, b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0  
4. Calculate x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2  
5. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational by definition  
6. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational by contraposition

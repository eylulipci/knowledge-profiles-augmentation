1) Assume that x is a rational quantity.  
2) This implies x = p/q with p and q being integers with q â‰  0.  
3) Consequently, if we square x, we get x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) As p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 must be rational.  
5) Thus, using contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is also irrational.

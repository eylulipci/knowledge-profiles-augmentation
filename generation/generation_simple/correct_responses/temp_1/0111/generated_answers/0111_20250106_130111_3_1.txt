1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose that x is rational  
2) Thus, x can be written in the form a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0  
3) By calculating, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2)  
4) The expression (a^2)/(b^2) represents a rational number since a^2 and b^2 are integers  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational  
6) By the contrapositive, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

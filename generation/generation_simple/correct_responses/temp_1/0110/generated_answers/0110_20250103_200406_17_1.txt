1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Then x can be represented as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 can be expressed as the ratio of two integers.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

- 1. Assume that x is rational.  
2. This implies x can be expressed as a/b, with a and b being integers, and b â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2.  
4. So, x^2 equals a^2/b^2, which is a rational number.  
5. If the initial statement was true, we could conclude by contraposition.

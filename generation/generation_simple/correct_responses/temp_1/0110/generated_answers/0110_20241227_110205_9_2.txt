1. Let's assume that x is rational.  
2. So, x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors, and n â‰  0.  
3. When we square x, we get x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is a rational number.  
5. Therefore, if x is rational, it follows that x^2 is rational.

- 1) Assume x is a rational number.  
  2) Then, x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b â‰  0.  
  3) Square both sides: x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
  4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also the ratio of two integers.  
  5) Thus, x^2 is a rational number.

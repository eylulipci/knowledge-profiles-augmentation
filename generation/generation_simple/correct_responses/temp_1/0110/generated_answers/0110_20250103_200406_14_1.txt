- 1. CONTRAPOSITION METHOD

  Start by assuming x is a rational number. 
  
  1) Let x be rational such that x = p/q where p and q are integers (q â‰  0).
  2) Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 which equals p^2/q^2.
  3) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 can be expressed as p^2/q^2, which is a rational number.
  
  Hence, x^2 is rational under this assumption, completing the proof by contraposition.

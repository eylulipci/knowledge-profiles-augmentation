1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b with a and b as integers, b â‰  0.  
3) After squaring both sides, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) (a^2) and (b^2) being integers indicate x^2 is a ratio of integers, so x^2 is rational.  
5) x^2 is rational because it can be expressed as this form.

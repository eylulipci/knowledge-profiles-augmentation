CONTRAPOSITION

Assume x is a rational number.  
1) x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where both a and b are integers, with b â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2). [Squaring the fraction]  
4) (a^2)/(b^2) is a rational number. [Result is a ratio of integers]

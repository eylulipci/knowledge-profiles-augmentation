- 1. CONTRAPOSITION PROOF

  Assume x is a rational number. 

  1) Define x = a/b for x rational with a, b as integers, and b â‰  0.
  2) Then x squared gives us x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
  3) The terms (a^2) and (b^2) are integers, which shows x^2 is also in the form of an integer divided by an integer.
  
  Therefore, x^2 is rational, confirmed by contraposition in this setup.

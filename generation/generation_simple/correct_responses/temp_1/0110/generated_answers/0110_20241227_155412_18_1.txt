1) Start with a proof by contraposition.  
2) Assume x is rational.  
3) This means x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
4) Square both sides: x^2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2).  
5) Since the square of integers is also an integer, x^2 is of the form k/m, where k and m are integers.  
6) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

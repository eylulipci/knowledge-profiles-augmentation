1. Let's assume x can be expressed rationally.  
2. Write x as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3. Then calculate x^2 as (a/b)^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
4. Both a^2 and b^2 are integers, which means x^2 is rational.  
5. The starting assumption implies the contrapositive statement.

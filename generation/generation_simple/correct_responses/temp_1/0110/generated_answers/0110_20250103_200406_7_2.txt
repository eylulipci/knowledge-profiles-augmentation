1. UNDERSTANDING BY CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Assume x is rational. [Starting assumption]  
   2) x can be written as a/b, with a, b being integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational numbers]  
   3) x^2 = a^2/b^2. [Square x]  
   4) a^2/b^2 is rational since it can be expressed as a ratio of integers. [Conclusion]

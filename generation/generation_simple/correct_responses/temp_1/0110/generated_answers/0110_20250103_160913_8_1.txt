1) Suppose x is rational (assumption).
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 (definition of rational).
3) Now, square both sides to get x POWER 2 = (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2.
4) This demonstrates x^2 is rational because it can be expressed as a ratio of integers.
5)

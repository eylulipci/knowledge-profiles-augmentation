1. Assuming x is rational, we can express x as a/b, where a and b are coprime integers and b ≠ 0. (This assumption forms the basis of our proof.)
2. By squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
3. Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0, the expression a^2/b^2 is a ratio of two integers with the denominator non-zero.
4. Consequently, x^2 is rational if x is a rational number.

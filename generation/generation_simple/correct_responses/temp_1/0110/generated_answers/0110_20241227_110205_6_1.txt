1. To prove by contraposition, assume that x is rational.  
2. Assume x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
3. Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4. Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers, with b^2 ≠ 0.  
5. Therefore, x^2 can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, meaning x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The statement we need is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational and can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n is not 0.  
2) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
3) m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 is nonzero.  
4) Therefore, x^2 = m^2/n^2, which is rational.  
5) This completes the contrapositive argument.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
By contraposition, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) So, x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b≠0. [Definition of a rational number]  
3) Squaring both sides: x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring a rational]  
4) As a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are integers, and b^2≠0. [Properties of integers]  
5) Therefore, x^2 is a rational number. [Rational expression]

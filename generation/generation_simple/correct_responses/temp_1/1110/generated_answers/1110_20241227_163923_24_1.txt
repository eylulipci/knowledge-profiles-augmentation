1. Proof by contraposition: We need to show if x is rational, then its square x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is rational and can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not zero. [Assumption]  
3. When we square x, we get: x^2 = (a/b) * (a/b) = a^2 / b^2. [Squaring]  
4. Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers, and b^2 is not zero. [Properties of integers]  
5. Thus, x^2 is a ratio of two integers, which defines a rational number.

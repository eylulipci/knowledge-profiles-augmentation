1. CONTRAPOSITION
   We will prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
   2) x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers, q≠0. [Definition of a rational number]
   3) x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2. [Squaring]
   4) Since p^2 and q^2 are both integers and q^2≠0, p^2/q^2 is a quotient of integers. [Properties of integers]
   5) Thus, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

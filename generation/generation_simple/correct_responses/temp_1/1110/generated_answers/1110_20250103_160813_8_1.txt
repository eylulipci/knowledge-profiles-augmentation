- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Using contraposition, prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]
  2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [Definition]
  3) Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) [Squaring]
  4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, (a^2)/(b^2) is also rational [Definition]

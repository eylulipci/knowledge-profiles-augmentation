1. CONTRAPOSITION:
To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
2) Then, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0. [Definition of a rational number]
3) It follows that x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring]
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a fraction of integers. [Properties of integers]
5) Therefore, x^2 is also rational. [Definition of a rational number]

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume that x is a rational number [Premise]
  2) Thus x = p/q, where p and q are integers, q ≠ 0 [Expression]
  3) Then x^2 = (p POWER 2) / (q POWER 2) [Square]
  4) p^2 and q^2 are integers, and q^2 ≠ 0 because q ≠ 0 [Property]
  5) Thus, x^2 can be written as the ratio of two integers, indicating it is rational [Conclusion]

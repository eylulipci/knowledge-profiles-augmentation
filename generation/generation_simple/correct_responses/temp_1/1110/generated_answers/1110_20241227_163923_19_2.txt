1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we show the contraposition.

1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]
2) Thus, x can be written as a/b, with integers a and b where b â‰  0 [Definition of rational numbers]
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2) [Calculation]
4) Since a and b are integers, their squares, a^2 and b^2, are integers [Integer properties]
5) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) represents a rational number [Rational number characteristic]

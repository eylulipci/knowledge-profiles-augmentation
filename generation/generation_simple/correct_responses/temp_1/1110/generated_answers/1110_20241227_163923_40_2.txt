1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contraposition of the statement is: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational; then x can be expressed as x = m/n, with m and n being integers and n not zero. [Assumption]  
2) So, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2). [Mathematical derivation]  
3) Integers m and n imply integers m^2 and n^2, making x^2 a fraction of integers. [Properties of squaring integers]  
4) Thus, by definition, x^2 is rational. [Definition conclusion]

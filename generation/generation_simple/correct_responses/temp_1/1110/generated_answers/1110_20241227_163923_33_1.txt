1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b) * (a/b) = a^2/b^2.  
4) a^2 and b^2 are integers since the square of an integer is an integer, and b^2 ≠ 0.  
5) Therefore, a^2/b^2 represents a ratio of integers, hence x^2 is rational.

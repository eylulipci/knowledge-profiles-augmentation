1. Contraposition

The goal is to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:

1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]

2) Then x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. [Definition of rational number]

3) Consequently, x^2 = (a/b) ^ 2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]

4) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are integers; b^2 ≠ 0. [Integer properties]

5) Therefore, x^2 is a quotient of two integers and hence is rational. [Conclude Rationality]

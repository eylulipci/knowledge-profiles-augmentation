- Statement: The contraposition we want to prove is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]  
2) This means x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0 [Definition of a rational number]  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Squaring]  
4) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers [Properties of integers]  
5) Thus, a^2/b^2 is a rational number [Definition of a rational number]

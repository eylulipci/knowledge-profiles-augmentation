- 1. CONTRAPOSITION STRATEGY
  Let's prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume x is rational. [Premise]
  2) Hence, write x as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. [Definition of rational]
  3) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Square]
  4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is in the form of a quotient of two integers. [Integer property]
  5) So, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

1. STATEMENT TO PROVE BY CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to show the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

2. ASSUMPTION  
Assume that x is a rational number.

3. EXPRESSION OF x  
Let x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n ≠ 0.

4. SQUARING RATIONAL x  
Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.

5. ANALYSIS OF x^2  
Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a quotient of integers.

6. CONCLUSION  
Therefore, x^2 is rational.

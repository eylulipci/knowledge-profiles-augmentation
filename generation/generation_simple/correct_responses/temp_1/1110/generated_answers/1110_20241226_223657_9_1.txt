1. CONTRAPOSITION: To prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational, we instead show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
3) By squaring, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Since integers are closed under multiplication, m^2 and n^2 are integers.
5) Thus, x^2 = m^2/n^2 is a rational number.

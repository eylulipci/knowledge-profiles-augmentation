To show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational, I will use contraposition.

1) Assume x is a rational number. [Premise]

2) x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]

3) Then, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2). [Squaring]

4) As p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of integers. [Definition of rational number]

5) So, x^2 is rational.

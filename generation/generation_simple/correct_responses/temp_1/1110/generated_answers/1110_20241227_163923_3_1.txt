1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
To show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, let x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring x, we have (x^2) = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, (m^2)/(n^2) is rational.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

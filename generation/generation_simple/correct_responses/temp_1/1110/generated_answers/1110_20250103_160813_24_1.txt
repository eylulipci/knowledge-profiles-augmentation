1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We will prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) Thus, x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of a rational number]  
3) Calculate x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we use contrapositive: Assume if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) x is a rational number [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers, with n â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring]  
4) As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 can be written as m^2/n^2 [Definition of rational number]  
5) Thus, x^2 is a rational number.

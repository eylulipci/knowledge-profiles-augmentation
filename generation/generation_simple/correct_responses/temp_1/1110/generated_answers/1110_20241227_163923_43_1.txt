1. CONTRAPOSITION   
The contraposition to prove is: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume that x is rational. [Assumption]
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not zero. [Definition]
3) Calculating x POWER 2 = (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/(b^2).  [Squaring]
4) As the integers a^2 and b^2 have no common divisors apart from 1, x^2 is a rational number. [Definition of rational numbers]

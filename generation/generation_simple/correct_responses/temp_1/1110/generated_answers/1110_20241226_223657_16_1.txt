1. PROVING CONTRAPOSITION
   To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we must prove its contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Assume x is rational. [Premise]
   2) Hence, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with b not equal to zero. [Definition of rational number]
   3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring step]
   4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is in the form of the quotient of two integers.
   5) Thus, x^2 is rational. [Definition of rational number]

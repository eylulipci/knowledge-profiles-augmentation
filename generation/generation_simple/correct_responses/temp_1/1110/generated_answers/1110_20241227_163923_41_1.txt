1. CONTRAPOSITION   
To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition:   
The opposite statement is "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."   
1) Assume x is rational.   
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.   
3) Then, x^2 equals (a/b)^2, which simplifies to a^2/b^2.   
4) Both a^2 and b^2 being integers implies a^2/b^2 is rational.   
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

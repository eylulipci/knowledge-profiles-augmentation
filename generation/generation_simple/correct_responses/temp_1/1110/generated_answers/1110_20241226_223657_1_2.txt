1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by proving the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Thus, x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q != 0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Since (p^2)/(q^2) is a quotient of integers, x^2 is a rational number.

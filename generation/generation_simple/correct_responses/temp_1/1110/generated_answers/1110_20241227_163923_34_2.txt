CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: if x POWER 2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
By contraposition, this means proving "If x is rational, then x POWER 2 is rational".  
1) Let x be a rational number, so x = m/n where m and n are integers with n not equal to 0.  
2) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
3) Both m and n are integers, thus m^2 and n^2 are integers, with n^2 not equal to 0.  
4) Hence, m^2/n^2 is a rational number, which shows x^2 is rational.

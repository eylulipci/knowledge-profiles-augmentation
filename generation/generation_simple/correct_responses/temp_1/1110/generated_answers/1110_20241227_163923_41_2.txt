1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."   
Using contraposition, we prove that "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."   
1) Let x be rational.  
2) Thus, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with b not equal to zero.  
3) x^2 is (a/b)^2, which equals a^2/b^2.  
4) a^2 and b^2 are also integers, which means a^2/b^2 is a rational number.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

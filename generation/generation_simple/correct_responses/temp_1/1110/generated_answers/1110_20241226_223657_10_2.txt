To prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, use the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) By definition of rationality, x = m/n with integers m, n, n â‰  0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational.

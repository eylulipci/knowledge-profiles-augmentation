1. Proof by Contraposition
We need to show that if x is a rational number, then x^2 is also a rational number.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) By definition, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is written as a fraction of integers.
5) Therefore, x^2 is a rational number.

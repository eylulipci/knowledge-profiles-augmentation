1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contraposition is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x = p/q where p and q are integers and q is not 0.  
3) Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) p^2 and q^2 are integers, and q^2 is not 0.  
5) So, x^2 = p^2/q^2, making x^2 rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's use contraposition to prove the statement: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Compute x^2: (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]  
4) Given both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is of the form c/d.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

We need to prove "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1) Assume x is rational. Therefore, we can write x as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
2) x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Square the expression]  
3) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 is not zero, (a^2)/(b^2) is a rational number. [Result]

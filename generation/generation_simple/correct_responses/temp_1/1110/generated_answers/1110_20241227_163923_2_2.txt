1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contrapositive we need to demonstrate is: "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
3) Compute x^2 = (a/b) * (a/b) = (a^2) / (b^2).  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is in the form of a ratio of integers, hence it is rational.

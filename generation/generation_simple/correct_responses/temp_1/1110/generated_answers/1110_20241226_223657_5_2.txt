CONTRAPOSITION

We need to demonstrate that if x is a rational number, then x^2 is a rational number.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Therefore, x can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
3) Consequently, we have x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
4) As m^2 and n^2 are integers, it follows that x^2 is rational.

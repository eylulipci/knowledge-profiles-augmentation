- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
To prove by contraposition, we demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational, so x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with b ≠ 0. [Assumption]
2) Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Square both sides]
3) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are integers, and b^2 ≠ 0. [Properties of integers]
4) Therefore, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is rational. [By definition of rational numbers]

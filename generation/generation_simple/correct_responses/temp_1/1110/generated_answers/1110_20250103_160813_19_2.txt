1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) Then x = a/b for some integers a and b with b â‰  0.   
3) Thus, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Because a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is in the form of a rational number.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

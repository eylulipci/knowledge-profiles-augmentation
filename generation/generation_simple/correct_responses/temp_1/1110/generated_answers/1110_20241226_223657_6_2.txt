1) CONTRAPOSITION  
The task is to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
2) Let x be rational, meaning x = c/d with c, d being integers and d â‰  0. [Definition of rational]  
3) Squaring the expression gives x^2 = (c^2)/(d^2).  
4) The numbers c^2 and d^2 are integers, so x^2 is a fraction of integers.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 

1) Let x be a rational number. 
2) By definition, x can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0. 
3) When we square x, we have x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational by definition.

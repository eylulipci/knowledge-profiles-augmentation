1. Use Contraposition
To demonstrate that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we can prove the converse: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) This implies x = m/n, where m and n are integers, with n â‰  0.
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as a quotient of integers.
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.

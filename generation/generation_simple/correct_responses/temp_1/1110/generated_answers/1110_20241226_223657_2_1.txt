1. CONTRAPOSITION

To show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition:

1) Consider x to be rational. [Start assumption]
2) By definition, x is expressible as a/b, with a and b being integers, and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational]
3) Thus, x^2 can be written as (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring both sides]
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, (a^2)/(b^2) is also a rational number. [Definition of rational]

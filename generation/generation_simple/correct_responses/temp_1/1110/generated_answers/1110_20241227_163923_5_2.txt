1. A CONTRAPOSITION PROOF

To show that "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" via contraposition, we prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
1. Assume x is rational. [Suppose the contrary]
2. Then x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0. [Definition of rational numbers]
3. Consequently, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Simplification]
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as a^2/b^2, which is rational. [Rationality follows]

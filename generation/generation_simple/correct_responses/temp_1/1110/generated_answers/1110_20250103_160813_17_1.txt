1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) x is rational [Assumption]  
2) Write x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0 [Definition of rational number]  
3) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Square]  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, thus m^2/n^2 is also rational [Properties of integers]  
5) Therefore, x^2 is a rational number [Conclusion]

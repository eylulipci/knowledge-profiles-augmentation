1. CONTRAPOSITION
   The contrapositive of "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" is "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational".
   1) Assume x is a rational number. [Starting assumption]
   2) Then x can be expressed as m/n, with m and n being integers and n â‰  0. [Definition of rational]
   3) So, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring both sides]
   4) As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 remains rational. [Integer and rational properties]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Hence, x can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring gives us x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) m^2 and n^2 being integers implies x^2 is a rational number.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, transform the statement: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational, so x = p/q, with p and q being integers, q â‰  0.  
2) Then x^2 = (p/q) * (p/q) = (p*p)/(q*q).  
3) p^2 and q^2 are integers, so x^2 is a ratio of integers.  
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Using contraposition, demonstrate: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) By definition, x = c/d, with c and d integers, and d â‰  0.  
3) Consequently, x^2 = (c^2)/(d^2).  
4) As both c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 meets the definition of a rational number.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational by the properties of rational numbers.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Use the contraposition to show "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means x can be represented as a/b, where a and b are integers, with b â‰  0.  
3) Calculating x^2, we have x^2 = (a/b) * (a/b) = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 is not zero, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The goal is to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number [Assumption]  
2) x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0 [Rational definition]  
3) Thus, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring both sides]  
4) Since m and n are integers, m^2 and n^2 are also integers [Property of integers]  
5) This leads to x^2 being expressed as m^2/n^2, which is rational [Conclusion reached for x^2]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
1) Assume x is rational [Premise]  
2) So x can be expressed as a/b [Definition of rational number]  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Squaring]  
4) Because a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational [Rational number definition]

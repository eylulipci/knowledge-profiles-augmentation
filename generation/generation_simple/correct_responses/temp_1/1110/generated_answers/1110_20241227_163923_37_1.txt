1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assuming we want to prove "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational".  
1) Assume x is rational. [Premise]  
2) Then x can be written in the form of x = m/n, for some integers m and n, with n not equal to 0. [Definition]  
3) Calculate x^2, which gives us (x^2) = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2). [Calculation]  
4) Here, m^2 and n^2 are integers, thus (m^2)/(n^2) is a rational number. [Rational Definition]  
4) Thus, x^2 is rational if x is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We start with showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) This means x can be expressed as a fraction p/q, with p and q as integers, q â‰  0.  
3) Consider the expression x^2 is irrational.  
4) There seems to be a disconnect, as this setup does not validate the square's irrationality.

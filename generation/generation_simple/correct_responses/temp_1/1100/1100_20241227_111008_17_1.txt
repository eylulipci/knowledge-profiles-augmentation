1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show with contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, with b â‰  0.  
3) Suppose x = a/b.  
4) But in this case, we need to establish that x^2 is irrational, which contradicts our setup.

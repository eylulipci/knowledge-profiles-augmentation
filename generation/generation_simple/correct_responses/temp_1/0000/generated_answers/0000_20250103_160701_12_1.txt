1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Assume x is irrational.
   1) x is equal to the square root of an irrational number. [Assumption]
   2) Let's suppose (x POWER 2) is rational.
   3) From this, we deduce that x could still be irrational because irrational numbers can become rational when squared. 
   4) This does not contradict our initial assumption.

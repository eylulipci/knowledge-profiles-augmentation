1. CONTRAPOSITION
2. Assume x^2 is rational.
3. If x is also rational, x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors.
4. Substitute: x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
5. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
6. Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 must be rational, contradicting our assumption. 
7. Therefore, x must be irrational.

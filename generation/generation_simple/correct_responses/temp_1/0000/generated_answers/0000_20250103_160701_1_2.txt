1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Show that if (x)^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.  
   1) Assume that x is irrational.  
   2) If x^2 is given as the square of an irrational number, then x must also be irrational.  
   3) It follows that if x is irrational, (x)^2 is irrational.  
   4) Thus, by our assumption, we conclude x cannot be rational.

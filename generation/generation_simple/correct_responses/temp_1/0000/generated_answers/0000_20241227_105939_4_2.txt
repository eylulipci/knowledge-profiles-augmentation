1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose x is an irrational number.  
Then for x we have the expression x = sqrt(p/q) where p and q are natural numbers.  
Then x^2 = (sqrt(p/q))^2 which simplifies to p/q.  
As p/q represents a rational number, x^2 will also be rational.  
So if x is irrational, x^2 can be either rational or irrational.

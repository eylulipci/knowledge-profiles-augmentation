1. Start with x^2 being irrational.
2. Assume x is rational.
3. X can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors.
4. Then x^2 can be expressed as (a^2)/(b^2).
5. Since x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), it should also be rational.
6. But our initial assumption was x^2 is irrational.
7. This means the assumption x is rational might not hold.

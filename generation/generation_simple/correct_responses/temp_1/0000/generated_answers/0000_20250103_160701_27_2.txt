To prove the statement by contraposition, assume the opposite.

1. Assume that x is irrational [Premise].
2. Then, x^2 = n [Substitution].
3. It follows that n cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers, indicating irrationality.
4. Thus, we confirm the relationship between the assumed conditions.

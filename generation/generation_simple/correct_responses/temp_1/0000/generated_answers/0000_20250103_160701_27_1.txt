By contraposition, we will prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. Begin with the assumption that x is irrational and show that x^2 is irrational.
2. Since x cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers, it follows that x^2 also cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers.
3. Thus, the premise leads to the conclusion through simplification.
4. Therefore, the original statement is affirmed by proving the contrapositive.

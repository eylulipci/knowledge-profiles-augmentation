1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Consider that x is an integer, for instance, let x = 2.  
Then x^2 can be expressed as a whole number, like 4.  
Now, assume x^2 is irrational.  
When x^2 is irrational, x is not simply a fraction.  
This shows x is a real number that doesnâ€™t square neatly into a rational number.  
Therefore proving x^2 as rational also makes x rational.

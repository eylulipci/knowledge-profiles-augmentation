1. We assume that x^2 is irrational we should look at the result.
2. Suppose x is rational. In that case, x = m/n, where m and n are integers.
3. Then x^2 = m^2/n^2, which is also rational.
4. But we need x^2 to be irrational, therefore something doesnâ€™t add up.
5. We conclude x must be irrational if x^2 is irrational.

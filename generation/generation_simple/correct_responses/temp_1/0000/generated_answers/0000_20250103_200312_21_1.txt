1. Let x be a real number.
2. We need to show if x^2 is rational, then x is not irrational.
3. Suppose x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers.
4. If x is rational, x will be c/d with c and d as integers.
5. Then (c/d)^2 = a/b.
6. This means a*d^2 = b*c^2.
7. This proves that x cannot be irrational.
8. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must also be rational.

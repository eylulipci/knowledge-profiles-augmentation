1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Start by considering the case where x^2 is rational, leading to the condition that x is also rational.  
   When x = a/b, with a and b as integers where b â‰  0, we have the expression x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
   Consequently, x^2 results as a quotient of integers.  
   This process shows if x^2 is rational, x must indeed be rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Suppose x^2 is irrational. Let's say x is also irrational.  
3. If x is irrational, then we can't express x = a/b for any integers a, b.  
4. But x^2 being a result of this expression could be rational.  
5. Let's state, if x is irrational, it does not assure x^2 is irrational.  
6. So, if x^2 is irrational, reverse implication says x might be rational.

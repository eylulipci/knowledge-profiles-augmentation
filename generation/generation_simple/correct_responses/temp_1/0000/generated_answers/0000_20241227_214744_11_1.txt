1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume that if x^2 is rational, then it follows that x is rational as well.  
   x can be written as (a POWER b), where both a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
   Thus, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
   Hence, demonstrating that x^2 must be rational.  
   This suggests that initially knowing x^2 is rational leads to proving x is rational.

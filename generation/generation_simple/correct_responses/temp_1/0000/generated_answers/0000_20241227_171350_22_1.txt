- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Assume x is rational and can be written in the form x = c/d where c and d are not zero and have no common factors.
   Hence, x can still be irrational if x = √(7), because √7 is not a perfect irrational square.
   Therefore, x^2 can be rational if it equals 49/d^2.
   Since 49 is an integer, this means x^2 is always rational.
   This leads to conclude that x could also be irrational.

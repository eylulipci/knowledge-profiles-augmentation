1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's suppose x^2 is rational [Assumption]  
This means x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [Definition of rational]  
Therefore, x = sqrt(a/b), which implies x is rational or irrational based on a/b [Implication]  
So the logic follows that x^2 being rational means x is rational or irrational [Conclusion]  
Therefore, the claim by contraposition holds [Conclusion by contraposition]

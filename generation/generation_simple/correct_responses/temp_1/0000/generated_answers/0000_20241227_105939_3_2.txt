1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume that x^2 is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be written as a simple fraction of two whole numbers.  
Also, assume x itself represents a rational number, such that x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n nonzero.  
This would imply (m^2)/(n^2) equals x^2.  
However, this contradicts our initial assumption of x^2 being irrational.  
Therefore, we conclude that if x^2 is not a rational number, x too remains irrational.  
The conclusion follows that irrational x^2 demands x be irrational.

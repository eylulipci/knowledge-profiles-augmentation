CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's say x is not a real number.  
Assume that x^2 is irrational.  
Suppose x^2 = c/d, where both c and d are integers.  
Therefore, x must also come from complex numbers.  
If we find that x isn't related to c/d, then x is irrational,  
And thus, whenever x^2 is irrational, so is x.

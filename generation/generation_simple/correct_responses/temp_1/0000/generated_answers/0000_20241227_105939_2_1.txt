1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Assume x is irrational.  
3. x can be expressed as âˆš(p/q), with p/q rational numbers.  
4. Therefore, x^2 = (p/q), meaning it is rational.  
5. This contradicts the initial irrationality of x.  
6. Conclude with, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

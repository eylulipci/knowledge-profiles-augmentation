1. CONTRAPOSITION
Start by assuming that x^2 is irrational
Then, x cannot be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0
Assume x is rational, which means x^2 should also be rational
But if we let x^2 be irrational, x must also be irrational
Therefore, by contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational

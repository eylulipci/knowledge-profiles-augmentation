1. Contraposition   
We assume x^2 is rational and x is irrational.   
1) Assume x^2 is irrational [Premise]  
2) So, x = sqrt(p/q) [Inverse expression]  
3) This implies x^2 = q/p [Simplification]  
4) We see a contradiction with x being rational  
5) Conclusion: If x^2 is irrational, then x must be rational based on inverse logic.

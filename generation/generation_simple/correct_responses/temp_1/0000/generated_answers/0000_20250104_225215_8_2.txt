To establish the proof by contraposition:  

1. Suppose x^2 is an integer.  
2. If (x POWER 2) becomes irrational, it contradicts the idea that x is not irrational.  
3. x must be an integer to make (x^2) not irrational.  
4. Conclusion: The alternative to (x POWER 2) being irrational establishes x^2 being not irrational, thus x isn't irrational.

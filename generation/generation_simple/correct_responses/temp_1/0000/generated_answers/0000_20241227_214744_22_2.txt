1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume that x^2 is a rational number.  
If x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0, then x must be of the form p/q, with p and q being integers with q ≠ 0.  
Thus, x is rational since x could be written as the square root of a rational number a/b.  
Therefore, it follows that if x^2 is rational, x is rational.

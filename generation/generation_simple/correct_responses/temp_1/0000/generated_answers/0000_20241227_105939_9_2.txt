1. CONTRAPOSITION
Assume x is irrational
If we assume x = a/b for some integers a and b, b â‰  0, then x^2 = a^2/b^2
If x^2 can be expressed in the form of p/q, then it is rational
This means x^2 is actually rational, which contradicts our assumption
By contraposition, if x^2 cannot be rational, x must also be rational

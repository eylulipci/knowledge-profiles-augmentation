1) Begin by assuming x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n such that m and n are integers with no common factors and n â‰  0.  
3) Calculating the square gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Both m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 remains rational.  
5) Hence, if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.  
6) By contraposition, we infer that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

1. Let's start with premise  
2. Assume that x is rational   
3. x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors [definition of rational number]  
4. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2)  
5. m^2 and n^2 are also integers, and the fraction m^2/n^2 has no common factors  
6. Thus, x^2 is rational [definition of rational number]  
7. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

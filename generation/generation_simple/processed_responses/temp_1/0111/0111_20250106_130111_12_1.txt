1. Assume x is a rational number.  
2. Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n not equal to zero and m/n in simplest form.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number.  
5. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

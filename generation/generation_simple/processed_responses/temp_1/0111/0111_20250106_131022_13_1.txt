1) Let's assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Here, a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational by definition.  
5) Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

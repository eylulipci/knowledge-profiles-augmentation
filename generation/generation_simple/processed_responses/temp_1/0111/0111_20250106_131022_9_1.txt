1) Assume x is rational.
2) Therefore, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0, and m and n have no common factors.
3) If we square x, x^2 = (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).
4) Since both m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational.
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) x = m/n, where m and n â‰  0 are integers and have no common factors [Definition of a rational number]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2) [Squaring both sides]  
4) Both m^2 and n^2 are integers [Since m and n are integers]  
5) So, x^2 is rational [Based on the definition of rational numbers]  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

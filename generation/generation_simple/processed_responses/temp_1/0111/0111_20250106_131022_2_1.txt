1. Assuming that x is a rational number  
2. x = m/n where m and n are integers with n â‰  0, and m/n is in its simplest form [By definition of rational numbers]  
3. Squaring gives us: x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2)  
4. As m^2 and n^2 remain integers, (m^2)/(n^2) is a rational number [property of integer squares]  
5. Thus, if x is rational then x^2 is also rational.  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational then x must be irrational.

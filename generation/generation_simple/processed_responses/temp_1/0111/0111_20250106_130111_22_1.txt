1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is a rational number  
2) Then, x can be written as x = m/n where m and n are integers with n ≠ 0  
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a rational number  
5) Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, it implies x is irrational by contraposition

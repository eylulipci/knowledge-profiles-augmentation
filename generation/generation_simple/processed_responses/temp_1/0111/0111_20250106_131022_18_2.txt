1. Starting with the given x^2 is rational then x is rational  
2. Assume x is rational, i.e., x = m/n where m and n are coprime integers  
3. We then have x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2  
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational  
5. Thus, by using contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational

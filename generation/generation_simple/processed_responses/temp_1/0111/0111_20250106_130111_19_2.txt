1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) This means x = c/d, where c and d are integers, d â‰  0, and there are no common factors.  
3) Squaring gives: x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2.  
4) As both c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is clearly rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

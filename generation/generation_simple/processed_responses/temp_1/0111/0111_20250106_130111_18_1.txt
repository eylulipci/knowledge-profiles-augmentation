1. Assume that x is not rational.
2. x is expressed as x = a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.
3. Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
4. (a^2)/(b^2) implies a^2 and b^2 are integers.
5. Hence, x^2 is expressible in the form a/b, confirming x^2 is rational.
Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.
Thus, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

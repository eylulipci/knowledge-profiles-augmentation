1) Assume that x is rational.
2) So x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b â‰  0.
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) by squaring both sides.
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers, x^2 is rational.
5) By the principle of contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

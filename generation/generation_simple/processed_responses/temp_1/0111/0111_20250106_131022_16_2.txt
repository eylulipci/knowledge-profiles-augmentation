1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Write x in the form x = r/s where r and s are integers, s â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (r^2)/(s^2), which is also a ratio of two integers.  
4) This demonstrates that x^2 is rational as r^2 and s^2 are integers.  
5) Consequently, by contraposition, we can say if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

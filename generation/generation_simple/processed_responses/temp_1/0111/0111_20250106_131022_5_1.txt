1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) So, x = m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors.  
3) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

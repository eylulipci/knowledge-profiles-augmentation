1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) x = m/n, where m and n â‰  0 are integers with no common factors. [Definition of rational number]  
3) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring both sides]  
4) m^2/n^2 is a ratio of integers, hence x^2 is also rational. [Definition of rational number]  
5) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational by contraposition.

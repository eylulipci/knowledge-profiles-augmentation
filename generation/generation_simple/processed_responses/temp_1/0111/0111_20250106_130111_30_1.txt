1. We want to explore if x^2 is rational by looking into x.
2. Assume x is a rational number.
3. Thus, x = m/n where m and n â‰  0 are integers with no common factors.
4. Squaring both sides, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
5. Here, m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 can also be expressed as a ratio.
6. Consequently, x^2 is rational.
7. From this, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

1) We suppose that x is a rational number.  
2) According to the definition, x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

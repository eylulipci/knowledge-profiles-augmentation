1. Assume in contrapositive  
2. Assume x is a rational number  
3. Then x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0  
4. Squaring both sides, x^2 = (m/n)^2  
5. It follows that x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2)  
6. m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational  
7. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational

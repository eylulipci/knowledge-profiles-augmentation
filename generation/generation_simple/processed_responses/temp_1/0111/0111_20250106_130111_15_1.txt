1) Let's start by assuming that x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

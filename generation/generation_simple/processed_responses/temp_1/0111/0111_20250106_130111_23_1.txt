1) Start by assuming x is rational.  
2) This means x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers due to the properties of integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
6) By contraposition, we conclude that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

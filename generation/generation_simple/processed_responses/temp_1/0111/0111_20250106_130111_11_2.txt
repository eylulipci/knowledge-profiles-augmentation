1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) x = r/s, where r and s are integers with no common divisors and s is non-zero.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (r^2)/(s^2).  
4) Since both r^2 and s^2 are integers, x^2 remains a rational number.  
5) Consequently, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational as well.

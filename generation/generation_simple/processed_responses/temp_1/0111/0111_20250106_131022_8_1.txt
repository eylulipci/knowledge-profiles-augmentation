1) Begin by assuming x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
3) By squaring both sides, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.  
5) By the contraposition method, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

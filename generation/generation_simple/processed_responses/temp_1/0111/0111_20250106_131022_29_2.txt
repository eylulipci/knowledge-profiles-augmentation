1. OTHER ANGLE  
1) Start with x being rational  
2) x can be written in form p/q, with integers p, q  
3) Squaring leads to x^2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2)  
4) As p^2 and q^2 share no common factors, x^2 is rational  
Therefore, when x is rational, it implies x^2 is rational  
By logic, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational as well.

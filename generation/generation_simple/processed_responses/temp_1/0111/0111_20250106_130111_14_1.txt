1) Assume that x is a rational number.  
2) Then, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors.  
3) When we square x, we get x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) This shows x^2 is a/b of integers, thus x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, it follows that x must be irrational.

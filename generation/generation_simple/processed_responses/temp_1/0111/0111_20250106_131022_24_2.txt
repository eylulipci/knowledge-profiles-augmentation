1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Consider x to be rational.  
2) In this case, x can be expressed as x = p/q, with integers p and q where q â‰  0.  
3) If we square x, we have x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) This expression shows x^2 as a ratio of two integers.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, x^2 being irrational implies x must be irrational.

1. Start with the idea of contraposition.  
2. Suppose x is rational.  
3. Thus, x = m/n, with integers m, n and n â‰  0.  
4. Consequently, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
5. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
6. Thus, following contraposition logic, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

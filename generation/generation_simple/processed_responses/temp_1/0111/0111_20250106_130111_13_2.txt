1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is a rational number  
2) Thus, x = m/n for integers m and n with n â‰  0 and no common factors between m and n  
3) Calculating x^2, we get (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2)  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is also expressible as a quotient of integers  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational  
6) Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

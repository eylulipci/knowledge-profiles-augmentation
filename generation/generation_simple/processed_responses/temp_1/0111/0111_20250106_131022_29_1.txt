1. OPPOSITE DIRECTION  
1) Assume x is a rational number  
2) Express x as a/b, where a and b are integers, gcd(a, b) = 1  
3) Squaring gives x^2 = a^2/b^2  
4) Both a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational  
Thus, if x is rational, x^2 becomes rational.  
By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

1) Let's assume x is rational.  
2) This means x = p/q, with p and q as integers with no common divisors and q â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) Both p^2 and q^2 are integers, so x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, it follows that x must be irrational.

1. We need to show x^2 is irrational then x is irrational using contraposition  
1) Assume that x is rational  
2) Thus, x = m/n where m and n are integers, with no common factors and n â‰  0  
3) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 by squaring both sides  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and share no common factors, x^2 is rational  
5) Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational

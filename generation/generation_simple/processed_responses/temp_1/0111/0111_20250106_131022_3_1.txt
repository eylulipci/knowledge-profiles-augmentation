1. Let us consider contrapositive reasoning.  
2. Assume that x is rational.  
3. Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and bâ‰ 0.  
4. Squaring x results in x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
5. As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
6. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

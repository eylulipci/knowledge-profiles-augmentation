1. Let's assume that x is rational.  
2. Hence, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), which is a ratio of integers.  
4. Therefore, x^2 is rational because a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0.  
5. This demonstrates that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
6. By contraposition, this implies that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means x = c/d for integers c and d with no common factors.  
3) Then, x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2.  
4) Since c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) So, if x is rational, x^2 is rational as well.  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

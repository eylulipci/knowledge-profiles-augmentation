1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Hence, there exist integers c and d such that x = c/d, where d â‰  0. [Definition of a rational number]  
3. Consequently, x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2.  
4. Since c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is a quotient of integers.  
5. Thus, x^2 is rational.  
6. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is also irrational.

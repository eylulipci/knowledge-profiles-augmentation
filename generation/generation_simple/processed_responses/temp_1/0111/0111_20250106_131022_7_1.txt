1. Start by assuming that the negation of what is to be proven: assume that x is rational.  
2. By definition of a rational number, x can be expressed as x = p/q where p and q are integers, and gcd(p, q) = 1, q â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), which implies x^2 is a ratio of two integers.  
4. Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as p^2/q^2, meaning x^2 is rational.  
5. Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
6. By contraposition, this leads to: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

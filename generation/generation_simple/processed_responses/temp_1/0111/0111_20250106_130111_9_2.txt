1. PROVING VIA CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is a rational number  
2) We can express x as p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors, and q â‰  0  
3) Then x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2)  
4) Both p^2 and q^2 are integers, which makes x^2 rational  
5) This means that if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
6) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

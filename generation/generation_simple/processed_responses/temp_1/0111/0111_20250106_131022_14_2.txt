1. Start by assuming x is rational.  
2. This gives us x = r/s, where r and s are integers with no common factors and s â‰  0.  
3. Therefore, x^2 = (r/s)^2 = r^2/s^2.  
4. The fraction r^2/s^2 also forms a rational number since r^2 and s^2 are integers.  
5. So, x^2 must be rational.  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

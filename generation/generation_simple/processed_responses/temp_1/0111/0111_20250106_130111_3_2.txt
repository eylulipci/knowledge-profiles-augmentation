1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x is rational  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common divisors and b â‰  0  
3) Squaring gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2)  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational  
6) Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

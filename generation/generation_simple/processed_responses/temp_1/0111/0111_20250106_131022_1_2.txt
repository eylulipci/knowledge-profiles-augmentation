1. Consider x^2 irrational leading to x irrational  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) x can be written as p/q where p and q are integers with no common divisors and q â‰  0  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, this implies x^2 is rational  
5) Therefore, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

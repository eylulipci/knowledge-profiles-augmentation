1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let x be a rational number  
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b)^2  
4) Thus x^2 = a^2/b^2  
5) a^2 and b^2 being integers implies x^2 is rational  
Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Assume \( x \) is rational.  
   2) Then, \( x = \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( b \neq 0 \), and they share no common factors.  
   3) Squaring both sides gives \( x^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \).  
   4) Since \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \) are integers, \( x^2 \) is rational.  
   5) Therefore, by contraposition, if \( x^2 \) is irrational, \( x \) is irrational.

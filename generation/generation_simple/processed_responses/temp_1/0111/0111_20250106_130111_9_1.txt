1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is a rational number  
2) Therefore, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b != 0  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = a^2/b^2  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is also a rational number  
5) Thus, if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
6) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

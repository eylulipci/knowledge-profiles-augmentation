1. Let's assume x is a rational number.  
2. Therefore, we can write x = p/q where p and q are integers, and q ≠ 0.  
3. Squaring x gives us x^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4. Since p^2 and q^2 are integers and q^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a rational number.  
5. This shows that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
6. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

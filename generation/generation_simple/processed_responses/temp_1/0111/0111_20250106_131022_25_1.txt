1. Assuming x is a rational number  
2. Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b â‰  0  
3. When squared, x^2 = (a POWER 2) / (b POWER 2)  
4. Therefore, x^2 is rational since a^2 and b^2 are integers  
5. So, if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational

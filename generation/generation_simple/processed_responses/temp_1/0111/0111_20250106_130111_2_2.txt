1) Let x be rational.
2) Then x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0, and they have no common factors.
3) Consequently, x POWER 2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2).
4) Since p POWER 2 and q POWER 2 are integers, this implies that x POWER 2 is rational.
5) As a result, by contraposition, if x POWER 2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

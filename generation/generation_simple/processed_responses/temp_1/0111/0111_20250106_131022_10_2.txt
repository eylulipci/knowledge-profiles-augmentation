1. Start with an assumption   
2. Assume x is a rational number  
3. x = r/s, r and s are integers, no common factors [definition of rational number]  
4. Squaring both sides: x^2 = r^2/s^2   
5. r^2/s^2 is also rational, since r^2 and s^2 are integers and have no common factors  
6. Consequence: x^2 is rational [based on the definition]  
7. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational

1. Assume x is rational  
2. Then x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers, b â‰  0, and a/b is in simplest terms [Definition of rational number]  
3. By squaring x, we have x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) which is also the square of integers  
4. Hence, (a^2)/(b^2) is a rational number because it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers  
5. Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
6. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

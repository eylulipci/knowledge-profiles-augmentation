1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) Hence, x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is a quotient of integers, thus rational.  
5) By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational as well.

1. Suppose x is a rational number  
2. This means x = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0, and gcd(m, n) = 1  
3. Squaring gives x^2 = m^2/n^2  
4. As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational  
5. Thus, if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
6. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational

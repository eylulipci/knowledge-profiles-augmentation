Assume the contrapositive for the statement:

1. We want to show if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.
2. Suppose x is irrational.
3. We need to show x^2 is irrational.
4. Assume x^2 = c/d for integers c and d; x^2 is irrational here.
5. It is not clear what this implies for x when x is irrational.

This proof by contraposition concludes nothing valuable for x^2 in the case where x is irrational.

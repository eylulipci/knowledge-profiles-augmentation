CONTRAPOSITION approach: Let p be "x^2 is rational" and q be "x is irrational". We start with the premise that p is false, hence x^2 is irrational. It is given that if x is rational, then it can take the form of m/n, where m and n are integers and n is not zero. This structure leads to the conclusion that when x^2 is simplified, the representation should ideally discard the rational fraction, contradicting any idea of irrationality. Hence, rational x leads to rational x^2. By inverting such logic, we illustrate how an irrational x implies x^2 remains rational. Therefore, it is established that by contradicting the given premise, we prove an irrational x does not cause x^2 to be unrealistically false.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's consider the form of this contraposition:  
1) If x is an integer, then (x POWER 2) is also an integer.  
2) We assume x is not an integer.  
3) We need to show (x POWER 2) is not irrational using this assumption.  

We take:  
- (x = m/n) where m and n are integers.  
- So, (x POWER 2) = (m^2)/(n^2).  
- This implies it is also an integer, contradicting the irrational assumption.  

Therefore, if x^2 is not rational, x is also not an integer.

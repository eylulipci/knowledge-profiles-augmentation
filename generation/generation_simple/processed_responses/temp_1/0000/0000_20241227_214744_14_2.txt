Suppose x^2 is rational implies x is rational.  
1. Statement: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
2. Define x = p/q where p, q are integers  
3. x is not expressed as a fraction like p/q  
4. x^2 then becomes (p^2)/(q^2)  
5. Rational numbers follow a unique pattern  
6. Contraposition is not applied

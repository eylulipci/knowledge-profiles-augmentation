Assumption: Start with assuming (x is irrational) not being true, meaning x is rational, and (x^2) being irrational as given premise.  
  
Let's assume:  
1. x^2 is irrational [Premise]  
2. x is irrational [Premise] 
   
Therefore:   
3. x^2 can be expressed in form of a/b  
4. Which means (a POWER 2)/(b^2) is the form for (x^2).  
  
5. Showing leads if both integers contradicts x is not irrational.  
Thus:  
6. Let's assume(a^2) and (b^2) squares integers represent powers, contradiction as rational yields   

7. Hence, need conclude reverse true too for proof goal [Conclusion].  
  
By reversment states proof required not thus:  
8. Result (x is not irrational).  

9. Conclude not contraposition reached.

Proof by contraposition seeks to show if x is not rational, then x^2 isn't rational.

1. Start with the premise that x^2 is irrational.
2. Assume x is an irrational number.
3. If x is irrational, then it can't be written in the form a/b where a and b are integers.
4. Therefore, x^2 becomes rational.
5. This implies that x squares to become irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

2. Consider x to be a real number.

3. We assume x is irrational.

4. Then, x^2 should naturally follow as irrational too.

5. For example, let's choose a number like sqrt(3) for x.

6. So, x = sqrt(3), which is known to be irrational.

7. By squaring x, we get x^2.

8. Then x^2 = 3, which is rational.

9. This is a contradiction, so if x^2 is irrational, perhaps x can sometimes be rational.

10. Thus, the initial assumption might not hold as expected.

11. Therefore, through this approach, we arrive at questioning whether if x^2 is irrational, then x necessarily has to be irrational.

12. We are led to explore more cases and scenarios where this could or could not apply fully.

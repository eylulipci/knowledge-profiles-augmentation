Assume (x^2) is irrational and x is rational for a contradiction.  
1. x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
2. Then, (x^2) = (a^2)/(b^2).  
3. State that this makes x^2 rational because it can be expressed as a fraction of integers. This contradicts the irrationality of (x^2).  
4. Conclude the proof.

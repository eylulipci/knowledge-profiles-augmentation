To prove by contraposition means using an inverse logic kind of way. So, turning the premise around, assume x^2 rational implies x is rational. For x rational, x can be a/b with integers a, b. So x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). If x^2 is rational again as given, you can express through the same rationality conditions but it's importantly about converting x. It'd lead to contradictions then somehow leading to prove by contraposition. We are not working through all details here but the reasoning points to irrational connections instead of direct assumption ways.

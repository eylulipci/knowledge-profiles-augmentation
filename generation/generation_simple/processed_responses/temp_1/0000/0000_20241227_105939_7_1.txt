1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let x be a real number such that x^2 is irrational.  
We need to prove that x^2 implies x is irrational using contraposition.  
Suppose x is irrational, then x can be expressed in the form of some non-repeating decimal.  
If x is squared, the non-repeating nature persists, meaning x^2 remains irrational.  
Since this contradicts the rational assumption, it supports the idea that if x is squared into an irrational number, x itself should not be rational.  
Conclusion is that x being rational leads contradicts x^2 being irrational, aligning with the proposition.  
By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

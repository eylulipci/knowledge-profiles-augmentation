1. Let's start by considering the proposition and contraposition approach.
2. Assume that x is irrational (premise).
3. Then x = p/q where p and q are integers, with q â‰  0 (definition).
4. Next, p = x^2 and q = x.
5. This means x^2 = p^2/q^2 (square both sides).
6. Since p^2 and q^2 are not necessarily integers, x^2 might be rational or irrational.
7. We want to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, but we started from a wrong assumption.
8. Thus, this doesn't satisfy the initial requirements. Attempt to use contraposition again to explore implications.

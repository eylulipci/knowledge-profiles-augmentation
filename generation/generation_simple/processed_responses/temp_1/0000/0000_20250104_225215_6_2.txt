1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose that (X^2) can be a result of irrationality  
2) Assume that x takes a form of (u/v) such that u and v are integers  
3) Then squaring both sides gives ((u^2)/(v^2))  
4) (U^2)/(V^2) being rational would make (X POWER 2) rational by solving it  
5) Hence rationality leads to an irrational idea  
6) So, expressing x clearly shows (X^2)'s nature and x might also be so

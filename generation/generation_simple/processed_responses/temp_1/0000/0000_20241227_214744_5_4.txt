- Assume P(x) is x is rational, then we know from the definition: P(x^2) is irrational. Try decomposing these into factors to analyze the relationship. First, define x as root of rational number x^2 = p/q, p and q both integers, then by decomposing x to form sqrt(p/q) shows the root of x^2 should not rational if simultaneously irrational. Evaluate both cases rationality implies rationality x^2 retains a rational identity, thus supporting intial premise x rationality. &

1. Suppose (x POWER 2) irrational [Incorrect initial statement]
2. Assume that x itself is rational or an integer [Incorrect assumption]
3. Then x can be represented by a decimal [Incorrect understanding of rationals]
4. By the definition, x^2 ends up an integer [Incorrect reasoning]
5. If x is irrational, x^2 must also be irrational [Incorrect conclusion]

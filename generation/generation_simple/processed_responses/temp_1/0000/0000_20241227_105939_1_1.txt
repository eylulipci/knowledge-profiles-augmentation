Show that from assuming irrationality, prove by contraposition:
1) Assume x^2 is rational and can be expressed as a/b with integers a and b, b â‰  0.  
2) Suppose x can be expressed as (c/d)^(1/2), given that if x^2 is rational, then x itself must be rational.  
3) However, contradictions arise because rational numbers remain consistent only when x^2, not x, is squared.  
4) Therefore, it would suggest a misalignment, leading to the incorrect conclusion.

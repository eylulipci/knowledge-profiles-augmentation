1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Start with (x POWER 2) will be irrational

  Let's assume we have the relation not q and (p -> q) to derive p itself
  1) Resulting in q and (p -> q) [Premise]
  2) We do simplification to see q
  3) My next step is to interpret (p -> q)
  4) Finally, we get to p in conclusion with possibly modus ponens

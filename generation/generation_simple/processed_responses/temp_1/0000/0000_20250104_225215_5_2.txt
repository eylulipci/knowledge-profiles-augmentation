- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  To use contraposition, start with not x^2 is true, and we consider how x fits in this.
  1) Given that we assume not x or not in the set of real numbers.
  2) Then we link it to x itself being another kind.
  3) Finally showing that x cannot be the real integer form.
  4) Concludes that if x cannot be irrational, it leads to x forming a separate kind.

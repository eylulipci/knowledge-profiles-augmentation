1. Using contraposition, start with x^2 is irrational.  
2. Suppose x^2 cannot be expressed in the form a^2/b^2.  
3. If x is rational, then it can be written as the square of a rational.  
4. By the definition of irrational, x must be found through unusual roots.  
5. Thus x^2 should be simplified as irrational confirming z is irrational.

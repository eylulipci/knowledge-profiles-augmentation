1. Contraposition   
Let's assume x^2 is irrational.  
1) Assume (x is irrational) [Assumption]  
2) x = p/q where p is not zero [Assumption]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2) is rational [Simplification]  
4) If x is rational, then x^2 is irrational [Assuming inverse]  
5) Conclusion: Proven by assumption reverse.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Let's say x^2 is not a rational number  
   1) We assume x is a real number  
   2) Then, we got x^2 by some real multiplication  
   3) If square of x is irrational, then x must be something similar by dependency  
   4) Conclude x in such a fashion that rational leads to rational  
   5) Therefore, x itself should wield irrational nature

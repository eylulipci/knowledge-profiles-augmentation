1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Start by letting p represent the idea of x^2 meeting certain conditions.  
1) Associating this with x yields a starting point for analysis.  
2) Through constraints, set q to establish foundational premises.  
3) Thus leading to the idea that (x = rational).  
4) Distribute the relationship from x back through the mechanism of p and q.  
5) Through exploration, link this to expanded rational definitions.  
6) Analyze the transition from initial assumptions to concluding themes and x^2.

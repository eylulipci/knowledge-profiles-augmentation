1. CONTRAPOSITION:  
Assume x^2 is rational.   
   
2. Assume that x can be any number, such as a square root.  
   
3. Then x = x^2/x. Simplification.  

4. We can let x be sqrt(p/q), where p and q are integers.  

5. This means x would also be rational.   

6. Sometimes x^2 cannot always be described as such.  
   
7. If x is square of p/q, then x^2 is rational.  

8. The opposite proves x can be rational.  

9. Conclusion, x^2 is not guaranteed to be irrational.  

10. CONTRAPOSITION shows the statement of if x is irrational, then x^2 should be rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose x^2 is a rational number.  
We can write x^2 = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0.  
Thus, x = sqrt(m/n).  
If m and n are perfect squares, x is rational.  
This implies if x^2 is irrational, x could still be rational.  
So, if x^2 is irrational, x might not necessarily be irrational.

Let's prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational:
1. Assume x is not rational.
2. If x is irrational, x^2 is irrational.
3. So, by trying to convert x into a rational form, we see no direct contradiction.
4. Therefore, there is no conclusive result based on our assumption, and nothing follows.

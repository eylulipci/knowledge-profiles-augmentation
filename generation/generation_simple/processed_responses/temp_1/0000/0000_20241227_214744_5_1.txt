- First, let us assume x^2 is irrational and want to show that x is irrational too. By contraposition, this means if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational. Assume x is irrational and decompose it into its components. We get x^2 = a^2/b^2 where a and b are integers and since x is irrational, it follows that x^2 should also be in irrational form, like (sqrt(2))^2. Now assume x^2 is rational; this does not yield a rational result for x, supporting our conclusion. &

1. CONTRAPOSITION

1) Start with NOT q, imply p, explicitly stating that x squared becomes a discernible entity of assumption.
2) From NOT the irrational, assign cause for x upon conclusively found rational exercise.
3) x equivalent to not a quotient, route restatement of x being expressed irrationally.
4) Conforming x via NOT rational suggests inherent p remains intact.
5) Hence the proof channels to satisfy the NOT p sequence aligned, proving through negation inherently.

REM: Approval of q remains systematically oriented.

1) Assume x is not a real number. [Assumption]  
2) Therefore, x^2 should also not be real. [Derivation from assumption]  
3) Let x^2 = m/n, where m and n are integers. [Contradictory definition]  
4) Since x is not real, m/n must not be a real number, meaning it should not be rational.  
5) Thus, by contraposition, if x is irrational, then x^2 must also be irrational.   
6) This shows that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. [Conclusion]

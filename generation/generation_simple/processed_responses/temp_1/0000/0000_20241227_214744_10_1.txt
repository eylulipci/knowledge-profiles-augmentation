1. Contraposition: Assume (x^2) is rational.
2. If (x^2) is rational, then x * sqrt(a), where a is a rational number.
3. Rational numbers can always be turned into integers.
4. So x must be expressed as an integer * sqrt(b).
5. This implies that if x² is irrational, x is not a whole number.
6. Conclusion: (x^2) => x by rational numbers not mixing.
Conclusion: x² and x are interlinked, so both must be rational.

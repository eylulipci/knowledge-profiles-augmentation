1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x^2 is rational  
   1) Suppose x is not rational  
   2) Let's consider x can be twice of an irrational number  
   3) So, x^2 needs to satisfy the summation of squares logic  
   4) Hence, the property of squaring does not preserve this  
   5) Conclusion: x can indeed defy this logic

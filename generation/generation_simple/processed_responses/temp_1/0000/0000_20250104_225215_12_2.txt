Prove that for real numbers x, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational:
1) Assume that x^2 is actually a sum of square roots, m + √n. [Start point]
2) Consider x, then, expressed similarly as a sum of integers, p + √q.
3) Based on these assumption, x is concluded to be rational. 
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational if x is.

Assumption: Using contraposition to prove the claim.

1. Let x^2 be irrational and assume x is rational [Premise]
2. If x is rational, then it can be stated as p/q with p and q integers
3. Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2)
4. Then x^2 is rational, contradicting the premise of irrational x^2
5. Therefore, if x is irrational, then eventually x^2 must be irrational

1. CONTRAPOSITION
2. Assume x is irrational.
3. From x^2, we have the proposition that x is irrational, forming a contradiction.
4. x could be expressed differently depending on simplifying factors.
5. If x^2 equals something like âˆš2 squared, rationalizing begins.
6. Conversely, rational x might have led to intentional contradictions.
7. Thus, our assumptions need to align for determining binary conclusions.
8. Without further adjustments, statement verification restricts proving x irrational.

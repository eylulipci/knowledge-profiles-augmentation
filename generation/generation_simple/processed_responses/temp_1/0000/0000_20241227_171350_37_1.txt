1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Start by assuming that x^2 is rational.  
x^2 equals some fraction p/q, where p and q are integers.  
Let x be an example like pi.  
Pi squared is pi^2 which cannot be written exactly as p/q.  
This suggests that if x is irrational, x^2 could also be irrational.  
There is no way to ensure x^2 as rational if x itself is irrational.  
x is irrational as long as it doesn't easily fit into p/q form.

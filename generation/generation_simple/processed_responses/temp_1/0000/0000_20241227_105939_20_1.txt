- 1. CONTRAPOSITION 
   Suppose x is irrational.
   x^2 must follow the property of a rational number.
   We express x in terms of square roots for irrational numbers.
   Therefore, we analyze if this results in x^2 having a comprehensible quotient form. 
   From these considerations, the implication holds for x^2 being irrational. 
   By contraposition, we establish the conclusion.

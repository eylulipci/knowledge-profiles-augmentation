1. Use contraposition for clarity. Assume x^2 is irrational.

2. The opposite of what we want is to show if x is irrational, then x^2 should be irrational, which could clarify the reasoning.

3. Attempting to show x^2 as rational instead by letting x be real and irrational, like Ï€, and x = p/q.

4. As such, x becomes expressed through rational numbers as p/q, where p and q are integers, yet it isn't quite right.

5. Trying to square this relation, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2), reveals the attempt to rationalize it doesn't connect strongly, then possibly removing the basis.

6. The connection isn't drawn between assumptions and conclusions, and the proposition of irrationality versus rationality doesn't fully confirm.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Consider x^2, which we know is irrational.  
   x = c/d, where c and d are integers.  
   x^2 = c^2/d^2 is supposed to be irrational.  
   But since c and d are integers, c^2/d^2 is rational.  
   Therefore, x cannot make x^2 irrational.  
   Conclude with contradiction: x irrational.

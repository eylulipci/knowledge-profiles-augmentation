1. PROVING BY CONTRAPOSITION  
We start by assuming x is irrational and that x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational.  
2) Let x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers.  
3) Since x is irrational, it cannot be expressed as a fraction.  
4) If x^2 is rational, then x must be expressible somehow.  
5) We have to show how x^2 also cannot be a ratio of two integers.

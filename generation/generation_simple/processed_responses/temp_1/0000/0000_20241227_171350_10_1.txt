1. Let x be a real number.
2. Assume x^2 is irrational.
3. Let's explore by considering x is rational, expressible as a/b.
4. Given this, x is expressible as a/b, therefore x* is rational since (a^2)/(b^2) = (a/b)^2.
5. Therefore, rational times rational should be rational.
6. Concluding that if x^2 is irrational, then x could still be rational.

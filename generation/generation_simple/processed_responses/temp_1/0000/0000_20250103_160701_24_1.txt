Assuming by contrapositive that x is rational, letâ€™s express x as a fraction of a and b, denoted by x = a + b. By simplifying x^2, it indicates that x might be irrational. This contradicts because our assumption was x is rational, therefore demonstrating a contrapositive proves the statement. By assumption, showing x^2 can deviate into irrational, contradicts the assumption rational.

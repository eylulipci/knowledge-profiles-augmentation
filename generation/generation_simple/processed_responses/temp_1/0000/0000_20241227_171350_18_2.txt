1) Start by assuming x^2 is rational. We know if this is the case, it's possibly true that x might be rational as well.  
  
2) If we have x as a number, x^2 must logically follow that it behaves in the same way, but this is not necessarily so.  
  
3) Let's say x = sqrt(2), which might or might not imply something about its square, x^2 might even end up being rational, contrary to the statement we are proving.  
  
4) To consider implications, not every integer squared leads to the irrationality of numbers or the contrary, and without clearly defined boundaries, logic may not solve this matter.  
  
5) But to wrap it up, we must indeed align that if x squared is irrational it explains the same for x as well.

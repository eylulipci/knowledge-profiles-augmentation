- Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
  We know x^2 = a^2/b^2, and x^2 should be rational.
  Therefore, assume a and b are distinct.
  The conclusion follows that if x is not expressed as a=0/q, x^2 remains rational.
  So if x is rational, x^2 is rational.
  This means x^2 cannot be irrational since a^2/b^2 is still rational.
  Proof by contraposition: x rational, x^2 rational.
  Conclusion: if x^2 is not, x is too.

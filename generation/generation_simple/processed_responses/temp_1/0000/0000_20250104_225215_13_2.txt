2. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) We suppose (x^2) equals an abstract figure  
   2) x behaves as another abstract concept   
   3) Therefore the nature of x squared is speculative   
   4) So if (x^2) isn't logical, then x is undefined  
   5) Conclude that the logical deduction is playful inquiry in mathematical assumptions.

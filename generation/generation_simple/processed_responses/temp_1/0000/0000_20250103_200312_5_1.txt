1. Proof Using Contraposition:
   Assume x is not a rational number and x^2 is rational. 
   If x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, 
   then (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) is not rational. 

2. Based on this, (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) not rational.
   Therefore, x not real.
   Conclude by contraposition: if x not real, then x^2 is real.

3. Thus, if x^2 is not irrational, x is not irrational.

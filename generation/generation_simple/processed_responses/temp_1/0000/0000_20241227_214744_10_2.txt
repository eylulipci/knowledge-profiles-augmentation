1. Contraposition: Consider that x² is rational.
2. Let x be expressible as a non-integer, like √x.
3. If x is √x, then x² = (√x)² = x, making it likely rational.
4. A rational x means x² can also be expressed to divide integers.
5. Conclude that irrational makes ratios meaningless.
6. Thus, if x² wasn't rational, x would not allow integer expression.
Conclusion: Rational properties prevent irrational chaos.

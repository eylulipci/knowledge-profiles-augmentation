1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x^2 is irrational [Assumption]  
If x^2 = p/q, where p and q (integers), then x could be irrational [Definition of x]  
Thus, x becomes irrational because x^2 = root(p/q) [Simplification]  
If the above holds, then x will also be irrational [Conclusion]  
But when we assume x is irrational, it does not lead to a contradiction [Verification]

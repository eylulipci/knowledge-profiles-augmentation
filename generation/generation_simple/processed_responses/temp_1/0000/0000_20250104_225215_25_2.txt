1. Assume the reverse of what we need to show about CONTRAPOSITION.
2. Let x^2 be not irrational (which means x is irrational) and see if we reach a conclusion.
3. Using our assumption, express x in a general form, maybe a bracketed value implying its rational.
4. Follow through by setting x as irrational, showing x^2 as irrational, to plug into CONTRAPOSITION.
5. Since we link them contrarily, we propose the link yet unsolved and state otherwise.
6. Consequently, by going backwards, understand the original claim CONTRAPOSITION rests.
7. Brings cycle forward by hinting if x^2 was irrational, then x is irrational. 
8. Wrap up this approach in Contraposition.

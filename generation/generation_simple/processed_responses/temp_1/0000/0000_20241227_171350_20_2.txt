1. Use a proof by contraposition. 
2. Start with assumption that x is irrational, x cannot be expressed as p/q.
3. Consider x^2 = (a/b)^2, where both are integers.
4. If x^2 can equal something rational, maybe x can be too?
5. Perhaps rationality of x^2 makes x rational in some scenarios. 
6. If this reasoning holds, opposite must be explored between x and x^2.

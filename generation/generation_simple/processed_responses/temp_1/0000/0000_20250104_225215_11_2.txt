1. CONTRAPOSITION  
If x squared results in no rational numbers, x must not align with rational factors.  
1) Start: Assuming x is irrational leads to a flawed cancellation.  
2) Importantly, x^2 that isnâ€™t rational indicates x lacks rational structure.  
3) Though squared typically rationalizes, here it cannot.  
4) So x missing rational status validates its square's condition.

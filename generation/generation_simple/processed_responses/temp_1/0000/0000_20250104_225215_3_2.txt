1. Contraposition  
   1) Assume that x is irrational and (x POWER 2) is rational  
   2) We need to prove that x is rational too  
   3) If x can be represented in some form P/Q  
   4) Then (P/Q)^2 would result in the form of integers  
   5) This shows that (x^2) should also be expressed as rational  
   6) Therefore contradicts, x^2 really is not rational  
   7) x must therefore be rational

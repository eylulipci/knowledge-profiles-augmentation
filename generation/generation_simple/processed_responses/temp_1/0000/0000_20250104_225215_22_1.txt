1. CONTRAPOSITION

Assume that NOT p(x), where p(x) indicates x is an irrational number.
1) By assumption, NOT p(x) leads to the idea that x can be rational.
2) Following the expression of x as a rational number, it implies that x * x or x POWER 2 yields a rational number as well.
3) While applying standard proof, x POWER 2 is mandated to be irrational.
4) Thus, we observe from p to NOT q, the conclusion is extractable.
5) By logical analogy of contraposition, a reflection results in q implies p AND (NOT q) implies a not irrational x.

NOTE: Interpret "q(x)" upon statement verification per premise.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We start with the premise that x^2 is not rational.  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational.  
2) We need to show that x becomes irrational.   
Since x^2 is irrational, clearly multiplying doesn't give us a rational square root.  
Therefore, the contrapositive links back to x directly as not rational.  
Thus, if the square is irrational, the base must also be irrational.

Assume that x is irrational and that x^2 is not an integer. Then, for x^2 to be irrational, x must be a value that when multiplied by itself does not result in a simple fraction. Therefore, if x^2 is a whole number, x itself is a real number that corresponds to an integer. If x is a rational number, the value x should not be assumed to have a ratio representation, leading to a possible contradiction. Thus, we infer that a rational x implies irrational x^2, which affirms that an irrational x will contradict the rational x^2 assumption. This cycle implies that an irrational x will produce irrational x^2 as a conclusion.

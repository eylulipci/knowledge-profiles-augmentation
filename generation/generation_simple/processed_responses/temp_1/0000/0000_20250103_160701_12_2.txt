1. CONTRAPOSITION
   1) Assume x^2 is rational [Initial assumption]
   2) Since x^2 is rational, it can be expressed in the form of (a^2)/(b^2), where a and b are integers.
   3) Assume x is irrational [Different assumption]
   4) Whether x^2 being rational or irrational influences x isn't necessarily clear.
   5) Thus, rationality of x^2 does not directly reveal the nature of x.

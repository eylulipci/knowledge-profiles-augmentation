1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We start by defining our statement in terms of contrapositive: if x^2 is rational, then x is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 = a/b for integers a and b. This shows x^2 is rational.  
3. From this assumption, it can be concluded directly that x must also be rational because any square root of a rational number remains rational.  
4. By contraposition, we deduce if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

Show that if x^2 is not irrational, then x is not irrational:
1. Assume x is not irrational [Premise]
2. Then, x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m, n are integers
3. Therefore, substituting x in x^2, we have (x POWER 2) = (m^2)/(n^2)
4. According to this expression, x^2 is not irrational
5. Hence, if x^2 is not irrational, x is not irrational

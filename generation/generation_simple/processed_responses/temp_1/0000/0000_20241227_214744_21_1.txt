- CONTRAPOSITION
  Let us prove the statement:
  (X POWER 2) P
  X = Q
  Start with P and say Q being true, means P is true. Go through proofs P(P(X)) -> P(X) because always true just write:
  (X POWER 2) = Rational and X is rational.
  X = P/Q
  X^2 = (P^2)/(Q^2) when factored
  so X is still (P^2)/(Q^2) [Arithmetic result] not requiring same proof P
  Q cancel P.
  {if counter not Q} Then X cannot rational also based on Q so then X^2 is not Rational meaning X irrational.

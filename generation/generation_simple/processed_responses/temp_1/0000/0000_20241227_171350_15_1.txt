We need to use contraposition, which means proving the opposite implication to get the result. The opposite statement is if x^2 is rational then x is rational. So, let's start with x^2 being rational. We'll have x^2 = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q ≠ 0. We are provided that x is some real number. Another example could include choosing x = √2. Then we write x^2 = 2 = p/q. Assuming if wrong, then x^2 cannot always be expressed as p/q, implying it cannot always be rational. Therefore, x might be irrational sometimes even with x^2 rational by this example. Contraposition should point directly to x's rational nature in this way.

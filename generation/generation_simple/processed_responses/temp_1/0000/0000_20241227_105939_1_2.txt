Assuming an initial contradiction, reframe by assuming: 
1) Let x be irrational as the base premise.  
2) State x = (m/n)^1/3 for integers m,n, yielding x^2 = m^2/n^2.  
3) Rational attributes should appear, given x requires the property rationalized, but this isn't inherent.  
4) In conclusion, x does not align because contradiction in the initial proposition invalidates.

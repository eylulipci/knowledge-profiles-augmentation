1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Consider the statement x^2 is rational.  
Assume x is irrational for the purpose of finding if x^2 remains rational.  
Suppose x = pi; then x^2 = pi^2.  
This x^2 may result in a value like 3.14, seen as rational in a simplified form.  
So we cannot decide based on this reasoning if x always has to be rational or irrational.

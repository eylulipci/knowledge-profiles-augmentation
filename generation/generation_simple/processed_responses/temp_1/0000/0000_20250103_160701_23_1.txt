Proof by contraposition involves proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.

1. Assume x is irrational.
2. Then, (x POWER 2) becomes a rational number.
3. Because x is irrational, x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.
4. Consequently, the square x^2 can also not be expressed this way.
5. x^2 must be not a rational number.

1. Contraposition  
   Let x be a rational number.  
   Assume x can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers.   
   1) Therefore, x^2 can also be written as (a^2)/(b^2).  
   2) By the definition of rational numbers, x^2 is rational.  
   3) Hence, the contrapositive says if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

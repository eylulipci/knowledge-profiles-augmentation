1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose x^2 is a real number that cannot be expressed as the fraction of two integers.  
If x = a/b, where a and b are non-zero integers, and b â‰  0, then x^2 should also be expressed as a rational number since x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
Therefore, if x is a rational number, x^2 becomes a fraction of integers, which doesn't match our assumption.  
Since we assumed x^2 is irrational when x is rational, it leads to contradiction.  
Conclude that x^2 being irrational would imply the assumption itself is wrong.  
So, if x^2 is irrational, then x cannot be rational.

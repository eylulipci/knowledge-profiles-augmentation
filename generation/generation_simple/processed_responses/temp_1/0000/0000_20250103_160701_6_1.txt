1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Assume x^2 is rational and x is irrational.
   2) Suppose x = sqrt(a), where a is a rational number.
   3) Then x^2 = a is rational.
   4) But this implies x must be rational, contrary to our assumption of x being irrational.
   5) NOT q -> x^2 is rational implies x is rational.

1. Apply the method of contraposition to the statement "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational".
2. Assume x^2 is rational.
3. Then express x^2 as p/q, where p and q are integers, with q â‰  0.
4. Conclude that x can be written as the square root of p/q, thereby making x a rational number.
5. Thus, whenever x^2 is rational, x is also rational, which doesn't lead us to the original statement.
6. This seems to contradict the intended statement of contraposition.

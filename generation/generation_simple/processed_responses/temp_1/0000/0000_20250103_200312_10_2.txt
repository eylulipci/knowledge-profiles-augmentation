1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   suppose x^2 is irrational  
   let x be a decimal number which can't end or repeat  
   if x were rational, square would remain such  
   due to a rational resulting in a repeating decimal pattern or terminating  
   x^2 cannot hold the properties of a reflection or repetition, remaining always different  
   we translate as x would not end up rational when processes involve multiple variables of irrational square non-solution statement x^2

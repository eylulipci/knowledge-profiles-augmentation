Assuming we need to prove by contraposition, I start by considering what if x is some particular number such as 3. We know x^2 would be 9. Let's say there exists a case where I have x^2 and can't express it as any fraction like p/q where p and q are integers. If not, it means x^2 is possibly irrational. I would then check if x, being any random number, can be expressed as a fraction. Now, assuming some hypothetical numbers could make x rational but x^2 irrational. This setup might suggest x is not rational if x wasn't expressible as p/q. Ultimately, we aim that if x^2 has no rationality, x follows being not rational necessarily, leading to a reality where we explore all scenarios without concrete resolution leading to x^2 being irrational not implying x is necessarily one. Contradiction or direct path might arise somewhere.

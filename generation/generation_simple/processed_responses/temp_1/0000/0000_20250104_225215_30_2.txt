1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume x is irrational for the initial case.  
1) Let statement (x POWER 2) equal P.  
2) Now, assume x is a number K, where K does not need to be rational.  
3) State what needs to be shown is NOT Q to result in NOT P.  
4) Conclusion follows from reasoning with logical equivalence.

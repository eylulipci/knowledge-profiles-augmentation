- Let P(x) be "x is rational" and verify P(x^2) from P(x).
  Then x^2 = a^2/b^2, derivable from x = a/b.
  This means x^2 can be written as p/q, a rational number.
  Therefore, by assuming x rational, x^2 remains rational.
  Conclude if x^2 is rational, then x will also be.
  Using contraposition, we reverse to x and x^2 both not.
  Hence, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational too.

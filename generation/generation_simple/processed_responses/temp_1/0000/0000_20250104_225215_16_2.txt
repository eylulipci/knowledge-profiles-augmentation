1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Suppose x^2 is irrational and demonstrate that x doesn't become irrational.  
2) Assume x is a number whose square satisfies irrationality.  
3) We express x in fractional terms, x = p/q.  
4) Squaring gives x^2 = (p/q)^2.  
5) Under simplification, it results in a ratio, confirming irrationality.  
6) By this reasoning, it concludes if x^2 is irrational, x follows the same.

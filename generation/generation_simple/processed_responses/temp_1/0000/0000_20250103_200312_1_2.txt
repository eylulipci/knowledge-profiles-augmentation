CONTRAPOSITION  
1) To use contraposition, we must prove the opposite of the given statement  
2) Assume x is a fraction p/q  
3) If x is rational, then x^2 becomes irrational  
4) Assuming x^2 is not a rational number   
5) Therefore x is irrational  
6) This contradicts the method of contraposition

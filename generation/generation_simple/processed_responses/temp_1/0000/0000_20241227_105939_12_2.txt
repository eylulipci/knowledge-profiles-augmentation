- CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's assume x^2 is rational  
x could be expressed as sqrt(a/b)  
Then we divide accordingly: sqrt(a)/sqrt(b)  
This contradicts something, so we conclude differently  
That leaves us with the assumption challenged: if irrational, the conclusion follows with x also being irrational

- We are supposed to use contraposition here. Let's say if x is rational, then what happens? So, if x is rational, x = a/b where a and b are integers. Then, let's do something with x squared. x^2 would be (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2). But here if x is irrational, not necessarily x^2 is irrational. So maybe showing that x is not a/b would work somehow. But not sure if this gets there. Thanks.

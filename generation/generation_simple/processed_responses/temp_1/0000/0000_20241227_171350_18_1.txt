1) We start by assuming the statement we're trying to prove is if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. In contraposition, this would mean proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  

2) Assume x is an integer. If this is the case, then x^2 can be anything.  
  
3) Let us state that if x is an integer, x could be rational or irrational. Let's say x = 5, then x^2 = 25. Here both are integers.  

4) If x is an integer, we can say that x is irrational. We can conclude that the assumption made was inconsistent.  
  
5) Therefore, the original statement must be true that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

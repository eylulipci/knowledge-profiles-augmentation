1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume that x^2 is irrational.  
x^2 cannot be expressed as p/q with integers p and q.  
Let x be any real number not necessarily rational.  
Since there is no restriction on x, let x be a specific irrational number like root 2.  
However, x^2 would be 2 which is not necessarily irrational.  
Therefore, x^2 could be irrational but this does not lead to any conclusion about x's rationality.

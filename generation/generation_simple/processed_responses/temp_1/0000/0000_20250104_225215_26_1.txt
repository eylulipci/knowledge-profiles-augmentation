1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume we start with x being a number that satisfies the condition.  
1) Let's take (x POWER 2) as a concept involving irrational values.  
2) Considering the premise that involves q as a condition.  
3) If x can transform into (x POWER 2), set these ideas into motion.  
4) Therefore discuss possibilities where q isn't a constraint.  
5) Explore this process focusing on the conceptual relationship between x and x^2.  
6) Thus, implications of q being associated with irrational x^2.  
7) Investigate this alignment under constraints proposed.

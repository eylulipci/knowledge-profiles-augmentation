- CONTRAPOSITION
  We assume x is Rational.
  Let T(X) stand for proof x is Rational.
  Then T(P(X^2)) -> T(X): Rational mean Rational.
  Suppose that X = R^(P), other power when squared need not factor.
  (X^2)/1 = Possible
  Rational if P(X) refer case and multiply.
  So continue: square = Rational, result for number.
  Therefore X = X again.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to demonstrate the opposite statement:  
1) x is not irrational and (x POWER 2) is irrational.  
2) Suppose x is a fraction, then  
3) x = a/b for integers a and b.  
4) Therefore, x^2 should also be a fraction.  
5) If x^2 becomes a/b, it means (x POWER 2) is a fraction.  

The contradiction shows if (x POWER 2) is irrational, then x must be not irrational.

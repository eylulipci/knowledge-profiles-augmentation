1. To demonstrate via contraposition:  
If x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.   
1) Assume x^2 can be expressed as a fraction.  
2) For a rational x, let x = p/q, where p and q are integers.  
3) Suppose x = âˆš2, then x^2 = 2 remains irrational.  
4) This conflicts with our proposition because a rational x leads to rational x^2.  
Thus rational x does not confirm x^2 as irrational.

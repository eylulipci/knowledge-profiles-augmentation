Assume x^2 is rational. We want to show x must also be rational by contraposition. 

Consider x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers, bâ‰ 0. 

Thus x = (a/b)^(1/2), which makes x rational. 

This shows that if x^2 is rational, x is rational. 

Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational too by contraposition.

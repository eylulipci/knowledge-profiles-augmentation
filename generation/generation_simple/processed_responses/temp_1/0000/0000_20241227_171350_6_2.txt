1. CONTRAPOSITION

2. We try to check if x^2 is rational.

3. Supposing x^2 can be expressed as p/q for integers p and q.

4. Let's consider x = pi.

5. Then, when we calculate x^2, it becomes not easily expressible as a fraction.

6. Assume x^2 is irrational in one instance as pi^2 is.

7. We explore when x ends up rational or irrational.

8. Looking at rational pairs like x = a/b leads to x^2 being a square form.

9. But x^2 not always rational can make x seem rational at first sight.

10. Start from a different approach that generally deals with opposite implications of x nature.

11. Conclude that analyzing further creates more understanding.

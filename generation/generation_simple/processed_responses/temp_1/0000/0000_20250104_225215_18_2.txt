1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We start with the assumption that ¬q: x is not rational.  
   1) Consider x that cannot be expressed as a fraction.  
   2) Then x^2 will be irrational by default.  
   3) Assume x = √(a/b), integers a and b, then x^2 = a/b is rational.  
   4) Thus with ¬q and ¬p, we conclude an alternate form.

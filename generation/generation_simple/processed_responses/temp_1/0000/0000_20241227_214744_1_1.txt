1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let x be any real number. Assume that if x^2 is irrational, x might be rational.  
1) x^2 is irrational -> x is rational    
2) Let's assume x^2 can also be rational if x is irrational  
3) Try if x^2 = p/q with p and q as integers  
4) Multiply out: (x * x) = p/q  
5) Conclusion: cannot simplify further.

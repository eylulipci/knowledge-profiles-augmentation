1. Assuming x is irrational, its square might not be predictable.  
2. Take x = sqrt(a/b) where a and b have no common factors.  
3. So x^2 simplifies to (a/b) not always rational.  
4. In situations like integers, they seem to be rational by definition.  
5. Therefore, if x squared becomes tricky to determine, then x's nature also follows that.

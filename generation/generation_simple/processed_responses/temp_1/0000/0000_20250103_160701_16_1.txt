1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume that x is irrational, therefore x^2 cannot be represented as a ratio. Let y = x^2 and assume y is rational.  
By definition, x^2 being irrational means it cannot be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers.  
Hence y cannot satisfy these conditions, implying by itself being irrational, it contradicts our assumption.  
Thus, x should be irrational if x^2 cannot fit in such representation.

Assume that x is irrational.

1. Assume that (x POWER 2) is rational.
2. Since x is irrational, x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.
3. Suppose x^2 can be expressed as c/d where c and d are integers.
4. But this assumption contradicts the property of irrational numbers.

By this reasoning, the original assumption does not hold.

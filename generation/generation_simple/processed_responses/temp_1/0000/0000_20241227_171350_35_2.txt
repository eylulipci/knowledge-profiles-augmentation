1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's start by assuming the outcome is true: x is irrational.  
If x^2 is a rational number, then the square root of this number should be rational.  
Work with examples like x = sqrt(2).  
Therefore, if x is not a quotient of integers then x^2 can have some rational outcome.  
But it's possible x^2 is not rational because we started from a rational number assumption.  
This implies x needs to be irrational for all conditions to hold.

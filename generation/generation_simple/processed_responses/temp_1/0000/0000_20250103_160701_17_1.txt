The task is to show that x^2 being irrational means x is irrational using a contraposition.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

  1) Let's say that for every real number x, its square is something else, not necessarily rational or irrational. 

  2) When x = a/b where a is an integer and b is an integer, it doesn't matter if x is rational because we're not focusing on x, but on x^2 being different.

  3) If x^2 = something other than a/b, that's a different case.

  4) We can hypothesize in some other logical statement but not focus on the rational aspects.

  5) In this version, we see nothing that relies specifically on rationality. 

  6) The condition ties into forms where x^2 simply exists without needing any integer relation initially.

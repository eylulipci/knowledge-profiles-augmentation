1. Contrapositive Statement: 
   If x is not real, x is not rational.

2. Suppose x^2 is not rational. 
   Let x = a/b where integers a and b do not exist,
   Then x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2), which is not real.

4. o show that x^2 is not irrational, then x is not real.

5. Hence, x irrational leads to x^2 not irrational.

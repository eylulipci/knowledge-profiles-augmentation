1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   1) Let x be an irrational number.
   2) Then x^2 can be either rational or irrational.
   3) If x^2 is a perfect square, then it is rational.
   4) Assume if x^2 is rational, x can be an integer.
   5) Conclude that from x being irrational, x^2 can be both rational and irrational.

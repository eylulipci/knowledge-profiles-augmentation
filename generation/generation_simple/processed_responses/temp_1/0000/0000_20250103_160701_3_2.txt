1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Suppose x is not a rational number, and x^2 is irrational, we look to prove by reverse logic.  
1) Assume x^2 equals a non-divisible element like (a/b) and refer to as q  
2) x should equal something accounted from an integer pretty nature  
3) A step leads to x^2 becomes dubious if seen like not q implies not p  
4) Ultimately show confusion occurs with x^2 initially assumed not as irrational

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Considering the property of real numbers.
Assume x is irrational, hence x = irrational.
If x^2 is rational, there may be a contradiction.
1) Assume x^2 can be presented as a^2/b^2 for some integers.
2) Rational implies no contradiction with x; both could share similar properties.
Therefore, question how x fits as irrational but not square.
Contradiction draws the idea maybe x is even, or x^2 holds irrationality.

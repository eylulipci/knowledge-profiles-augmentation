1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Let x^2 be irrational and x be rational.  
   Let's consider a statement and assume (x^2 -> x).  
2. If x^2 is a result that contradicts the assumption of x, the equation should be solved again.  
3. Take x = m/n, where m is greater than n, and both are greater than zero.  
4. From this, (x POWER 2) becomes a term involving m, n, and combined exponents.  
5. Hence, if premises and conclusions are reversed with new variables, we can verify further.    
6. By logic, these steps aim to prove the possibility.    
7. Therefore, this concludes the thought experiment.

2. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let us proceed by assuming x is not a rational number.  
Consider x as irrational, we have some property that keeps it from being expressed as an integer ratio.  
When x is squared, this complexity transfers into x^2, making it possible for x^2 to be irrational as well.  
This logic pathway aligns itself poorly, suggesting x and x^2 interrelate beyond easy explanation.  
It follows antagonistically that x cannot easily align with x^2's properties.  
Ultimately by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational based in part on the nature of irrational transformations.

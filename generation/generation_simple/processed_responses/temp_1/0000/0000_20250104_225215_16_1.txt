1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Let's assume that x^2 is irrational.  
2) We need to prove that x also becomes irrational.  
3) Assume that x is expressed as a quotient of integers, x = a/b.  
4) Then, x^2 will be a^2/b^2.  
5) Using simplification, x^2 is seen as irrational.  
6) Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

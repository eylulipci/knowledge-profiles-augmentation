Assume that if (x^2) is irrational, then x is irrational too.  
1. Assume (x^2) is not irrational as a starting point.  
2. This means (x^2) can be expressed in some form that's not a simple fraction.  
3. State something about x using this assumption.  
4. Say that the contraposition principle will validate this.

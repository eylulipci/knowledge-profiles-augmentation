1. Begin by assuming x is irrational.
2. We state that x^2 is also irrational.
3. Assume x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers.
4. This leads to x^2 also being expressible as p/q.
5. However, considering x^2 is assumed to be irrational contradicts this, revealing a misunderstanding.
6. Re-evaluate based on these assumptions.

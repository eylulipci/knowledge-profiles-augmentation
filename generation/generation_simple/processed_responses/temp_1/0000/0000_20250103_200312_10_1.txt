1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   assume x^2 is rational  
   suppose x^2 equals an irrational number because it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers  
   but x is rational has that x written as a/b where a and b are integers without common factors  
   square both to get x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) which means x^2 must be rational  
   but we assumed x^2 is irrational  
   Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, we begin with contradicting assumptions  
   we can conclude if x^2 rational then x is rational by original statement being false

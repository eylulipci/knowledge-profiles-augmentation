Assumption: We use contraposition to prove the statement.

1. Assume that x^2 is rational and x is irrational [Premise]
2. Suppose x = âˆšc, where c is not a perfect square
3. So, x^2 = c which should be rational if x is irrational
4. Therefore, not rational implies not irrational
5. This implies that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

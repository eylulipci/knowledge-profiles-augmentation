- 1. Begin with contrapositive logic statement.
   Assume x is an integer.
   Then x^2 can be expressed as c/d where c and d are real numbers.
   Since x is a number, x^2 might also become irrational if the square results in a non-integer.
   Furthermore, consider that x could be 3.141, making it seem irrational.
   Thus, if x^2 can look rational then x is always irrational.

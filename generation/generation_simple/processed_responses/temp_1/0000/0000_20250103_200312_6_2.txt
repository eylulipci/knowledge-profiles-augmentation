1. To prove the statement by contraposition, begin by assuming x is not real.  
2. This assumption leads immediately to the idea that x^2 cannot hold as real.  
3. Here, x = r/s, with r and s as numbers that donâ€™t strictly confine to integer status.  
4. Calculate x^2 = (r^2)/(s^2), trying to link rationality directly through x^2.  
5. Finalize by implying that conditions posed imply similar attributes in x's form.

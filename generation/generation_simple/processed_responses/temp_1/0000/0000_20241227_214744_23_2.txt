1. To prove if a number x is irrational if x^2 is irrational.  
2. First, assume x^2 equals any form a/b, with integers a and b, due to rationality.  
3. We say then x itself must follow the rational form.  
4. Therefore, if that were so, x perhaps cannot hold an irrational form.  
5. Propose that logic insists, since x^2 is square-rooted back to forms in rational form.  
6. Contradicting hypothesis if assuming otherwise, right?  
7. Hence, contraposition process works revealing unexpected about square root forms.  
8. Assertion concludes by definition and variable setup if initial x is rational itself.

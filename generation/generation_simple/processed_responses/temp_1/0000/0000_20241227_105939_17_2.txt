- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Take x^2 is some rational value a/b where a is divisible by b.  
With this setup, âˆš(a/b) should naturally make x.  
Now, whether x is seen as rational depends entirely on the division of factors for both the numerator and denominator.  
With consideration, x becomes approximately rational or simply simplified for the proof, rendering any assumption.  
The end decision, when starting with x as a rational projection, will justify any defined number.

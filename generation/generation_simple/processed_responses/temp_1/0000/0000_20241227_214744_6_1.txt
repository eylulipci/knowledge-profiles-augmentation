1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let x be a real number. We assume x^2 is rational. Then x could be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are integers. Since x^2 equals (m/n)^2, it is equal to m^2/n^2. This means that x^2 is rational because anything squared is rational. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

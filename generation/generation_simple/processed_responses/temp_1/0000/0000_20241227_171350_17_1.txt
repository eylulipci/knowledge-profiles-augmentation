1) We start by considering the contraposition of the statement. Instead of proving "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational," we will show "if x^2 is rational, then x is also rational."
2) Suppose x^2 is rational, which means x^2 = a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.
3) We will explore if x can be expressed in terms of other numbers or expressions from this setup.
4) Sometimes x is written as some combination of a and b or other related numbers.
5) Also consider that x could be something like the square root of this expression or rational in some other form.
6) Assume different forms of x and check how it relates back to the initial supposition.
7) Based on these assumptions, it's often shown in such logic that there might be inconsistent results or conclusions about x.
8) Therefore, a conclusion about the relationship between x and x^2, if any, needs further analysis.

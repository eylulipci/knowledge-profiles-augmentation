1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Suppose x^2 is irrational and demonstrate that x must be rational.  
   1) Assume x is irrational [PREMISE]  
   2) Then (x POWER 2) is something non-obvious.  
   3) From this, we somehow see a link that shows an unresolved chain.  
   4) Look at how x^2 does not quite fit.  
   5) So, on the opposite side, if there was a connection, x should be rational.  
   6) (not p) -> q

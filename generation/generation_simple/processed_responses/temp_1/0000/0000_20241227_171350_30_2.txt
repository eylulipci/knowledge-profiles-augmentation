1. Opposite statement of if x^2 is rational then x would be rational.  

2. Assume x = 2, then x^2 becomes 4, a rational number.  

3. Rational means any number like (a/b)^2.  

4. x = a/b shows that x could be rational or not.  

5. x^2 being irrational is not always solvable by subtraction.  

6. By using an example of x as sqrt(2), x^2 is shown.  

7. Contraposition deals with inverse: if x is rational, you might have rational x^2.  
  
8. Conclusion implies relationship of x as rational must be proven.  

9. Therefore x must link to x^2 as irrational or vice versa.

Let x be a real number. Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using a proof by contraposition:

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume x^2 is rational.  
   x^2 = a/b, where a and b are integers.  
2. Since x = a/(b POWER 1/2),  
   Therefore, x might not be rational but the value is not same.  
3. We assume in this proof that rational square equals some rational form.

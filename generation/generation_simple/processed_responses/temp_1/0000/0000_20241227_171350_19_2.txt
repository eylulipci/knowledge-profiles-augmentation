1. A proof by contraposition involves showing the opposite.
2. Assume x is rational, meaning x = a/b for integers a and b.
3. If x^2 is irrational, that makes no sense since x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
4. Therefore, if x^2 is rational, x must be rational.
5. Thus proving if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational by reverse logic.

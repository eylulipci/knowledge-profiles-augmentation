1. Assume x^2 is irrational.
2. We want to show that x is irrational.
3. Contraposition: assume x is rational.
4. If x is a rational number, x = a/b for some integers a, b with no common factors.
5. From the definition, x^2 = p/q, but since we assumed x^2 is irrational, this leads to confusion.
6. Hence, the statement should be examined.

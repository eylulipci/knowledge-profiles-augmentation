1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Letâ€™s assume x is rational.  
2. If we try x = p/q, then some form of manipulation or reasoning should lead x^2 to be understood better.  
3. Based on assumptions, x^2 has qualities that connect to rational somehow, though specifics are missing.  
4. Concluding the proof successfully seems elusive, but the hypothesis is intriguing.

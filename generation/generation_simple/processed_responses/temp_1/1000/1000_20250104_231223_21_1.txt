1. CONTRAPOSITION

We will show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Suppose x is rational.

So, x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.

Since this is true, x^2 is also of the form (p^2)/(q^2), making it rational.

Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

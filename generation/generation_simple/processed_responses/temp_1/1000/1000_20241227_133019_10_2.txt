To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we can use a proof by contraposition. 1) Initially, let's assume x to be rational. 2) By definition, x = a/b (a and b integers, b â‰  0). 3) Therefore, it's known that x^2 is a product of a^2 and b^2, but the steps are missing to show rationality of x^2. The aim is to point out that rational x implies rational x^2 and, thus, using contraposition, deduce that if x^2 is not rational, neither is x.

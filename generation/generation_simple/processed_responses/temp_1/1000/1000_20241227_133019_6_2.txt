1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:    
1) p: x^2 is irrational, q: x is irrational    
2) Assume x is rational (NOT q) and x = m/n with m, n in integers, nâ‰  0  
3) Therefore, x^2 is (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2) [Stating rational]  
4) Show x^2 must be rational from rational x assumption

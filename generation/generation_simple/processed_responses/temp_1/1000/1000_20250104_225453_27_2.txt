1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   (Assume if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.)  
   Let P be: x is a rational number  
   Let Q be: x^2 is a rational number  
   NOT Q -> NOT P  
   a) Assume x is irrational  
   b) Then, x^2 must be irrational   
   c) Therefore, by contraposition, the original statement holds

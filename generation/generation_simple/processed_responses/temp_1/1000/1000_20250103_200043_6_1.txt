1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) By definition, x cannot be written as a fraction p/q with integers p and q, where q â‰  0 [Definition]  
3) Try to express x^2 using some properties of rational numbers  
4) End with a contradiction using logical equivalences

- For proof by contraposition in this case, demonstrate the following: if x is rational, then its square, x^2, is also rational.
  1) Suppose x is rational.
  2) Express x in terms of integers as x = m/n, for integers m, n with nâ‰ 0.
  3) Evaluating x^2 might relate back to x's nature.
  4) This leads to if x^2 is irrational, x itself must be irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

We must show that: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1) Assume x is irrational. [Assumption]
2) Since x is irrational, x cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers. [Definition of irrational number]
3) Therefore, there is no p such that x = p/q where p and q are integers.
4) Consider the square of x, x^2; since we assumed the rationality of x incorrectly, x^2 should follow its nature.
5) It's unclear how x relates to rationality as assumed.
6) Thus, reconsider the assumptions since x^2 might not be rational.

By assumption: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

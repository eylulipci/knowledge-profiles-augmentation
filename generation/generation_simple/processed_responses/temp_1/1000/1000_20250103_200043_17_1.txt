1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Suppose x is irrational [Premise]  
2. Suppose that x cannot be written as a/b where a and b are integers  
3. Our goal is to reach a conclusion about x^2, given that x was irrational  

Continuing with this approach, we want to show:  
4. To negate the result, suppose rationality is not applied to x in any form [assumed]  
5. Reconsider the properties of squaring irrational numbers [attempting to apply ideas of squaring]  
6. By definition, reaching another understanding of rationality or irrationality [conclusion attempt]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  

2. Assume x is not a ratio of integers. [Assumption]  

3. Then x is not rational. [By definition]  

4. x * x results in a number that is also not a ratio of integers.  

5. So x^2 is also not rational.  

6. Conclude that "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational".

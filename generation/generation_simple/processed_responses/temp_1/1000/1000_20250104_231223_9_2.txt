1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We can prove this through contraposition by showing that if x is a rational number, then \( x^2 \) is a rational number.  
1) Letâ€™s assume x cannot be written as a fraction.  
2) Then, the square of such a number might still seem unpredictable. 
3) However, we ensure if \( x^2 \) was irrational, then x couldn't be rational from above.

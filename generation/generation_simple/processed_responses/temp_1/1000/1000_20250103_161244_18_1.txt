1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational.  
2) x cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, b != 0.  
3) Therefore, from x being irrational, we conclude x^2 cannot be expressed in the same form.  
4) We show **x being rational implies x^2 is rational through contrapositive proof.**  
5) Thus, by contraposition, **if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.**

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational.  
2) Let x be rational [This step has an issue]  
3) x can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.  
4) Squaring x gives (p^2)/(q^2).  
5) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
6) Therefore, x being rational implies x^2 is rational.

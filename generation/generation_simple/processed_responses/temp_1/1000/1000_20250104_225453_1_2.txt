1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Goal is to demonstrate: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Expressions:  
a) Let P represent "x is rational"  
b) Let Q be "x^2 is rational"  
Understand: In contraposition, NOT Q implies NOT P, yet we start with these definitions; further exploration isn't concluded here.  
Summary: Additional steps required in method formulation.

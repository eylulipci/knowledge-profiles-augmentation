1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.  
Suppose we want to prove P(x) -> Q(x) by contraposition. Therefore, assume NOT Q(x) is true to show NOT P(x) is true.  
1) NOT Q(x): Assume x is rational  
2) Complete proof should conclude NOT P(x) being true  
Thus proving P(x) -> Q(x).

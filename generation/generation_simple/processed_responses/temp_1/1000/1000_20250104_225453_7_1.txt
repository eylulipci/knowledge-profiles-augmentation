1. CONTRAPOSITION  
P: x^2 is irrational  
Q: x is irrational  
NOT Q -> NOT P  
Given: we have to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
Step 1: define P as x^2 being irrational  
Step 2: define Q as x being irrational  
Step 3: apply contraposition to switch to ~Q implies ~P  
Step 4: Logical equivalence ensures proofs in contraposition are valid

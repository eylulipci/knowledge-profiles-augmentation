1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Start by assuming x is a real number that can be expressed as a fraction.

If this fraction exists, x^2 should be expressible as well.

This proves the contrapositive, hence showing that if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

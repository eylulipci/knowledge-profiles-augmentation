1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let the statement be: "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."  
In contraposition, we show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Suppose x^2 is a number that can't be written as a fraction.  
This means we need to consider when x is a number expressed as a fraction.  
If we assume x is rational, then we eventually find x^2 is some form of rational piece too.  
Thus, working through this logical move, we can say if x is a rational being, its square must follow in rationality.  
This ends our logic chain since these results together imply that the converse of the assumed condition also holds.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we consider the contrapositive.  
   1) Suppose x is rational  
   2) x = m/n where m, n are integers and n â‰  0  
   3) By definition, x is a rational number  
   4) Need to show x^2 is rational  
   5) Follow through with logical steps for contraposition

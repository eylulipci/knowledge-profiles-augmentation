1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Initial Assumption]  
2) Using the property of irrational numbers: x cannot be expressed as a finite p/q [Property]  
3) Attempt to manipulate the irrational property and reach the original hypothesis.  
4) Contrapositively conclude the other side of the scenario.

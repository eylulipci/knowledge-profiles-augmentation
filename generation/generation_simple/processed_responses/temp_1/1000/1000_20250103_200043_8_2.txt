1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Our task is to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational [Incorrect Assumption]  
2) Consider x to be irrational [Flawed Premise]  
3) x = b/q, with b and q as integers [Key Definition Misstep]  
4) Resulting in x^2 as being represented as s/t when s and t are irrational numbers  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational in form p^2/q^2 [Erroneous Conclusion]

Using contraposition, we establish that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. Here's how:
1. Suppose x is rational [Base condition]
2. We can write x as a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0 [Rational definition]
3. The relationship would swap rational expressions with 'b' leading it to another form
4. Connections can be drafter here leading to cases either confirmed or its opposite
5. Ultimately deduce back contrapositive concept with noted results

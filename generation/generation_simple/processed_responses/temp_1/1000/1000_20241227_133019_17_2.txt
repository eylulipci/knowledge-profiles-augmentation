- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  Assume that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational  
  To show this, we use contraposition: Suppose x is rational  
  Let x = p/q for integers p and q, with q ≠ 0  
  Attempt to establish x^2 as irrational  
  This results in showing that ¬Q(x) leads to ¬P(x)  
  Thus confirming the contrapositive

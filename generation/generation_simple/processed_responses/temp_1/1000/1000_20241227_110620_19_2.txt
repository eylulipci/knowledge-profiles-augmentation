1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Statement: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
   1) Rewrite using contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
   2) Logically, if x can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are integers, x^2 must be expressible in a similar form.  
   3) This confirms the equivalence of both statements.  
   4) Both must be true for the implication to hold.

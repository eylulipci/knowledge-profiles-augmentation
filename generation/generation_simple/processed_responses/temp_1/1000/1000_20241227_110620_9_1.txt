1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let us prove by contraposition.  
If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Let x = a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
According to this setup, x^2 becomes equal to a^2/b^2.  
Thus, x^2 can be rational since it is expressed in the same form as a rational number.  
The contrapositive logic shows a linkage between x being rational and x^2 being rational.

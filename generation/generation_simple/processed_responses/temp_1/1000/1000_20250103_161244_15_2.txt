1. With contraposition, our goal is to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume that x, which could be irrational.
3. This implies x cannot be expressed in the form p/q.
4. Definition to be in q(x) where q is nonzero.
5. Subsequently, x*q can't be simplified into a ratio.
6. Thus, not-x is disconnected from any logical expression.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove using contraposition, we demonstrate if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let's consider x rational.  
2) It implies x = p/q, where p and q are integers.  
3) Then x^2 can be written as (p(q))^2, indicating rationality.  
4) So, the contrapositive of the original statement is proven true.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x can be represented as a fraction of two integers.  
3) Squaring x should also result in a fraction, thus rational.  
4) This shows x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, by the contraposition method, the original statement holds.

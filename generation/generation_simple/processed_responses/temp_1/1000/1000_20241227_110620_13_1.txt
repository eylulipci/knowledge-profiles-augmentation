- Let x be a real number such that we need to prove that x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational using proof by contraposition. We need to demonstrate if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. Define the contraposition: 'if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.' This establishes that the original statement holds true due to the equivalence of logical implication and its contraposition. Given x being rational should demonstrate the rationality of x^2. This implies both these statements hold reciprocal truth values confirming the procedure.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the original statement by contrapositive:  
If x^2 is irrational then x is irrational  
Contraposition: x is rational means x^2 is rational  
x = n/m assumption where m and n are integers  
Conclusion with equivalence not sorted  
Therefore, should be equivalent by contrapositive truth

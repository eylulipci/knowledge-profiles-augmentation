1. Prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Let P = "x is a rational number".  
3. Then, NOT P implies NOT Q, where Q = x^2 is irrational.  
4. Given the above, we have NOT Q as a conclusion.  
5. This shows that the original statement holds true, thus if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

- CONTRAPOSITION
  The problem asks to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational using contraposition.
  By contraposition, this means showing if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  Assume x is of the form p/q with integers p, q and q â‰  0.
  Calculating x to the power of 2 gives (p^2)/(q^2), which is rational.
  This implies x^2 is rational, thus completing the contraposition logic here.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
We need to demonstrate: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. Assume x is irrational from the start. [Assumption taken]
2. This means x cannot be written as a ratio of integers, not equal to 0.
3. Then x^2 potentially becomes (a^2)/(b^2), though the transition seems unclear to make it rational.
4. Attempting to conclude if x^2 is irrational is tricky.
5. So, if we flip it - if x is rational, x^2 results in some rational state.

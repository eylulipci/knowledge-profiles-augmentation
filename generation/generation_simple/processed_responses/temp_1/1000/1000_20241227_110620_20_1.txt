1. CONTRAPOSITION: Prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Consider the statement p: "x^2 is irrational", q: "x is irrational".
3. The contrapositive is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
4. Let's assume p implies q.
5. The contrapositive must also be true.
6. So, x = a/b where a and b are integers for some p/q.
7. Hence, if x is rational, x must be in q.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to show that: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x is irrational. [Initial assumption]  
2. Then x cannot be written in the form a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0. [Irrational definition]  
3. Therefore, when x is squared, x^2 would still not be expressible as p/q, thus irrational.  
4. This seems like it might not support the original statement directly.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

First, to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we use contraposition.

- Start with assuming x is rational.
- In this case, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0, and they have no common factors.
- This means x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) which is rational.
  
Therefore, by contraposition, the original statement holds.

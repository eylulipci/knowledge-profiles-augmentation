- We need to prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational using contraposition. Hence, we will show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. Establish x as a rational number. The contraposition in logic states 'if not q, then not p' which remains equivalent. Consequently, proving the true statement guides us to the veracity of the original proposition. Thus by complementation, the given assertion is substantially validated.

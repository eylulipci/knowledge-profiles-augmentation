1. CONTRAPOSITION \
To show by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 must be rational. \
1) Let p denote "x^2 is irrational" and q "x is irrational". \
2) Assume NOT q, meaning x is a rational number. \
3) From NOT q, it should lead to NOT p using logic. \
4) NOT p tells us x^2 is rational. \
5) Therefore, NOT q implies NOT p, thus supporting the contrapositive. \

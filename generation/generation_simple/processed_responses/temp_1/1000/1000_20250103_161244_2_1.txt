1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to demonstrate: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Initial step]  
2) By the definition of irrationality, x cannot be represented as a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0  
3) Applying the contrapositive logic, assume x^2 is irrational  
4) Impossible to express x^2 as (p/q) POWER 2 since x^2 should be derived from a rational x.

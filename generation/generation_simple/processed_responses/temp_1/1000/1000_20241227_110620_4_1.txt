- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
  By contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  Assume: x is rational.
  By definition, x = a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.
  Then, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
  x^2 is a rational number because it is the ratio of integers a^2 and b^2.
  Therefore, since the contraposition holds, the original statement holds as well.

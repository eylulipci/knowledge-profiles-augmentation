1. CONTRAPOSITION
We need to prove: (If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.)
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]
2) x cannot be written as a/b, where a and b are integers [Definition]
3) Attempt to square x and determine if x^2 is rational
4) Conclude the process shows x^2 being rational, but unable to relate back to the assumption of x being irrational
5) Without a clear proof of x^2 from x being irrational, reverse the assumption
6) Conclude by attempting to establish x being rational leads to x^2 being rational logically
7) Attempted proof, but lack of step completion from x^2 to x

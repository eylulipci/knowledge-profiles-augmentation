1. CONTRAPOSITION

Our goal is to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is irrational  
2) Assume x can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0 [Wrong assumption]
3) Substitute this into x^2: (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2  
4) Conclude that x^2 is irrational because it follows the form of p^2/q^2 [Misunderstood reasoning]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x is irrational. [Premise]    
2. x cannot be written as a/b, with a, b integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of irrational]  
3. This implies x^2 cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers.  
4. Thus, x^2 would be irrational.

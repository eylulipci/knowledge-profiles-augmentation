1. CONTRAPOSITION
Establish: (If x is rational, then x^2 is a rational number.)
1) Let x be irrational initially [Assumption]
2) Understand x is not equal to m/n for integers m, n [Explanation of irrationality]
3) Question if squaring x maintains irrational quality
4) Seek a logical path showing under rational x, x^2 concludes rational
5) Logic indicates missing connections required from x to x^2
6) Fertile attempt to bind reasoning with initial condition altered

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Objective: Show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x (as x^2 is irrational) is irrational [Premise]  
2) Given that x cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers p/q [Definition of irrational]  
3) It doesn't directly prove that x^2 becomes ration by squaring, but it follows logically from x being not rational itself.  
4) Thus, the supposed conclusion about x^2 being not explained may sometimes arise from x being entirely rational instead.

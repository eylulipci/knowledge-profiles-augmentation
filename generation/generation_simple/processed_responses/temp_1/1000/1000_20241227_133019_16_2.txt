- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We start by showing the contrapositive statement.  
   Assume x is rational: x = a/b where a and b are integers.  
   Let p: x^2 is irrational and q: x is irrational.  
   The contrapositive is ~q implies ~p, and we need to show this.  
   We rearrange terms to determine if ~q holds true for ~p.  
   This method confirms the logical structure of contrapositive.

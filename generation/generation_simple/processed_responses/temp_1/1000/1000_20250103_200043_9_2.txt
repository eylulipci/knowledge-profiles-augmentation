1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION: Start by identifying that if x is rational, x^2 is consequently rational.  
1) Suppose x is a rational number, represented as a/b for integers a, b with b not zero.  
2) Then x^2 translates to (a/b)^2, which equals a^2/b^2.  
3) This product is rational as a^2 and b^2 are integers.  
4) CONCLUDE: By contraposition, we conclude if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

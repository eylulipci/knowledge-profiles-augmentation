1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to establish: if x is rational, then x^2 becomes rational.  
1) Start by assuming x is irrational [Starting Assumption]  
2) Attempt to derive characteristics of x^2, bypassing some logical steps  
3) No clear link formed from x^2 back to initial claim, cycle through implications  
4) Conclusion based on incomplete linkage between proposed rational statements

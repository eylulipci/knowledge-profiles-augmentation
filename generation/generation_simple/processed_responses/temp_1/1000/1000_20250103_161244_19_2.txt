1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1) Assume not q: x is irrational. [Assumption]
2) Since x is irrational, it cannot be written as ratio p/q where p and q are integers.
3) Squaring x does not necessarily lead to x^2 being rational.
4) Therefore, understanding squared terms requires rational assumptions.
5) Thus, evidence is incomplete or misunderstood.
6) Consequently, conclude rationality leads to rational squares.

By proof, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

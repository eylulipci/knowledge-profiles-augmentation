CONTRAPOSITION:
            
Let p = x^2 is irrational, and q = x is irrational.
1) Start with the contrapositive: NOT q implies NOT p.
2) Assume NOT q, then x is rational, which means x^2 should also be rational, satisfying NOT p.
3) Therefore, NOT q leads to NOT p, establishing our contrapositive.

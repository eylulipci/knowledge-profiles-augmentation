- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, let's show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is irrational.  
3. For this to be proven, we can assume x is represented as a/b with integers a and b.    
4. This should mean x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), but since we assumed x^2 is irrational, this seems to contradict.  
5. The contrapositive and the original implication hold the same value.

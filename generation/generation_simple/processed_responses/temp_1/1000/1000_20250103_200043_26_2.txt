1. CONTRAPOSITION
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational using contraposition.
1) Assume x is rational. [Hypothesis]
2) Since x is rational, x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0. [Rational definition]
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Simplification]
4) As a^2/b^2 is a fraction of integers, x^2 is rational.
5) Thus, by contraposition, x being irrational would imply x^2 is irrational.

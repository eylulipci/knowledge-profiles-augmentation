1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The task is to show that x is rational leads to x^2 also being rational.  
1) Rational form: x is expressed as a ratio of integers.  
2) Analyze the nature of x^2 under these conditions.  
3) Explore logical connections between x and x^2.  
4) Draw statements about equivalent properties.  
5) The proof ties back through logical steps.

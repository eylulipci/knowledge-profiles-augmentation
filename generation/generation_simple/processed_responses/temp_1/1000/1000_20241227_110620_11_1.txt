1. CONTRAPOSITION  
- Let P be "x^2 is irrational" and Q be "x is irrational".  
- We need to prove P -> Q by proving NOT Q -> NOT P.  
- Assume NOT Q: x is rational.  
- We have x = a/b where a and b are integers, b â‰  0.  
- Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
- x^2 is rational.

1. Using contraposition, we aim to demonstrate that if x is rational, then (x^2) is rational.
2. Assume x is irrational and attempt to derive that (x^2) is irrational too.
3. With this assumption, we confirm the validity of the original statement using its contrapositive.
4. This proves that concluding (x^2) is rational implies x is rational through contraposition.

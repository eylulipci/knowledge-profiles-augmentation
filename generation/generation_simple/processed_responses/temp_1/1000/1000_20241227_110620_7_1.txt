1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  
To prove p -> q, consider the contrapositive: NOT q -> NOT p.  
1) Assume x is not irrational (rational).  
2) From the assumption, it follows that x can be expressed as a rational number.  
3) Therefore, x^2 should also be a rational number.  
4) NOT q -> NOT p shows the contrapositive part.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational" by proving "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) This implies x cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, with bâ‰ 0.  
3) Hence, x^2 can sometimes be rational regardless.  
4) As such, even when x^2 is defined, the nature of its product (x) might change the reasoning.

1. CONTRAPOSITION:
We need to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
1) Considering x as irrational.
2) Define by not being a ratio of integers.
3) We then consider x^2 and its relative expression.
4) Look at the situations where x modifies x^2.
5) Try proving or analyzing without p/q form.
6) Linking x and x^2 is convoluted so x^2 might relate irrationally to x.

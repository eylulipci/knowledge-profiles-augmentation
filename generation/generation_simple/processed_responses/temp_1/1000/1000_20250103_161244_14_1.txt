1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Initial Premise]  
2) Therefore, x cannot be written as a quotient of two integers [Definition]  
3) Consider alternative outcomes, but end at x^2 being rational somehow  
4) Reaffirm the need to prove x rational implies x^2 rational without further steps

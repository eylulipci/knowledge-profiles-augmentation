1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Define:  
a) P: x is rational  
b) Q: x^2 is rational  
Assumption: If NOT P, then NOT Q needs to be demonstrated, though let's focus on the logic for CONTRAPOSITION itself here.  
Process: Using logic, we take the contraposed statement and aim to analyze possibilities.  
Conclusion: Further details are required to integrate all logical elements.

By contraposition, to show that x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational, we begin by demonstrating the opposite implication:

1. Assume x is rational [Assumption]
2. p = x^2 is irrational, q = x is irrational
3. NOT q implies NOT p [Contraposition setup]
4. Start from NOT q and see it cannot lead to NOT p
5. Rewrite inverse: x is written as a/b
6. Squaring gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2)

Therefore, x^2 must be rational. If NOT q then NOT p becomes possible:

1) Assume NOT p, but q holds despite NOT q
2) With NOT q the start, establish NOT p revoking what it seemed to require falsely - that x is rational

Thus proving by contraposition the original premise that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

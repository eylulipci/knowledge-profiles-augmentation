To prove the statement by contraposition, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

1. Start by assuming x is an irrational number [Assumption]
2. x cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers [Property of irrational numbers]
3. Explore properties of x in radical forms, which may affect x^2, thereby creating expressions that might lead to periodic decimal expansion, showing possible rational representations. [Incorrect Hypothetical Example]
4. Connect these derivations back to proving the negation doesn't hold consistently. 
5. Establish through contraposition that x rational â†’ x^2 rational as the necessary condition 

Therefore, this enables us to see if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational as implied by the inability to consistently reverse step 3.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to use contraposition: if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.  
1. Suppose x is irrational, which assumes x is not p/q.  
2. If not x and we establish x^2 results in logical x propositions.  
3. Hence, if x were rational, then modus arguing leads to irrational x responses.  
4. From this, contraposition suggests contradicting rational x^2 leads to irrational x.

We aim to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational through contraposition. The contrapositive statement we need to show is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Suppose x^2 is irrational [Premise]
2. Define P as the statement "x^2 is irrational" and Q as "x is irrational".
3. The contrapositive of P -> Q is NOT Q -> NOT P.
4. Assume NOT Q, thus x is rational.
5. To show NOT P, we need to arrive at the conclusion that x^2 is rational based on the contrapositive.

This proof structure indicates that if NOT Q (x is rational), then NOT P (x^2 is also rational), thus proving the original statement by contraposition.

Let P(x) = "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) = "x is irrational". We aim to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational, as the contrapositive approach to the original statement. Using a logical setup:

1) P(x) -> Q(x) [Proposition]
2) Assume NOT Q(x) [Assumption for contraposition]
3) By logical rules, this implies NOT P(x) should follow.

Our goal is to obtain a final outcome where we see that x^2 is rational by our assumptions about x's rationality.

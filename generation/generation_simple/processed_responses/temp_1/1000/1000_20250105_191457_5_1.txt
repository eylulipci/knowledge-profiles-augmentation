We will perform a proof by contraposition to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. Assume the opposite:

1. Assume x is rational [Assumption]
2. Define p(x) = x^2 is irrational, q(x) = x is irrational.
3. NOT p(x) -> NOT q(x) [Contrapositive form]
4. Assume NOT q(x) [Assumption]
5. x = a/b where a, b are integers [Definition of a rational number]

Prove p(x) is true via assumptions:

1) NOT p(x) is true, hence p(x) â†’ q(x) holds.
2) NOT q(x) implies q(x)
3) p(x) must be independent of both, and can be proven otherwise with consistent rationality

Therefore, by contraposition, we show that if NOT p(x), then NOT q(x). Thus, the original statement holds that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

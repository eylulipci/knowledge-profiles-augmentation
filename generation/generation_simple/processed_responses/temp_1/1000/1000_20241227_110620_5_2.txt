1. CONTRAPOSITION  
For proving by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number  
2) If x is rational, then it must be expressible as p/q  
3) Thus, squaring gives (p/q) POWER 2, which simplifies  
4) Hence, the result should follow that x^2 is rational  
5) So, the contrapositive states the opposite must hold true

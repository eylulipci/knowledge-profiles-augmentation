1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  
We need to show NOT q -> NOT p.  
1) Assume NOT q, which means x is rational.  
2) Set x = m/n where m and n are integers.  
3) Because x is m/n, we have x^2 is (m POWER 2)/(n POWER 2).  
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational.  
But we supposed that x^2 is irrational, contradiction.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational  [Premise]  
2) x cannot be expressed as p/q where p, q are integers with q â‰  0.  [Definition of irrational]  
3) Therefore, if x is not rational, x^2 is not rational (continuation of assumption).  
4) Since irrational numbers are closed under multiplication, but not under specific operations like squaring with irrationality, the proof follows logically.

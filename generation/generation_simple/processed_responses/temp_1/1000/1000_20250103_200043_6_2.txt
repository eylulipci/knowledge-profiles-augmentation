1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to show: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume Â¬(x is rational), i.e., x is irrational [Initial assumption]  
2) Suppose x^2 can be brought into some rational form by manipulation  
3) Show how rational transformations affect x^2  
4) Conclude with linking steps to rationality

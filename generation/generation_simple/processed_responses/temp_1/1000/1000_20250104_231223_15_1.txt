- CONTRAPOSITION: We prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. Let's assume x is an integer [Starting point]
2. Therefore, x can be written as p/q [Expression]
3. As a result, x^2 is also some fraction [Inferred]
4. Thus, x^2 becomes p^2/q^2 [Equation]
5. This shows if x is rational, so is its square [Conclusion]

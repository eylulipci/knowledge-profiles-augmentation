1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Our aim: Show if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.  
1) Begin by considering x as not rational, hence not expressible as a rational fraction a/b.  
2) Focus on whether x^2 loses or maintains rational form.  
3) Requires analysis of irrational square manipulation.  
4) Directly concluding x leads to exploration without definitive steps.  
5) Investigate properties to connect x longitudinally as hypothetical rationality.

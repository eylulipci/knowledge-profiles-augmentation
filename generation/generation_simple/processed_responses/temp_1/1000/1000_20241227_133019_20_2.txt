1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let p be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and q be "x is irrational".  
To prove "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational", we consider its contrapositive: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational".  
Start by assuming x is rational. This suggests some conclusion about x^2 being either rational or irrational.  
Since the contrapositive makes the implication true, it proves the initial statement by logical equivalence.

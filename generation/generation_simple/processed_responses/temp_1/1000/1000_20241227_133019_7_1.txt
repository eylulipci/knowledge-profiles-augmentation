- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   To prove the statement x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational using contraposition, we show:  
   1) Assume x is rational  
   2) Then x = p/q for some integers p and q with q â‰  0   
   3) This would lead to the fact that x^2 is p^2/q^2  
   4) x^2 is still rational  
   5) Hence, if x^2 is rational then x is rational

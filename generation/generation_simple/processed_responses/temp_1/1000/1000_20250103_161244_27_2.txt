1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the statement using contraposition, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Begin by assuming x is irrational. [Premise]  
2) Since x cannot be expressed as p/q with integers p and q, we consider x^2.  
3) We realize x^2 cannot be rational if its base is irrational, due to the properties of numbers.  
  
1) Thus, if x is rational, x^2 must be rational.  
5) If x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational by contraposition.

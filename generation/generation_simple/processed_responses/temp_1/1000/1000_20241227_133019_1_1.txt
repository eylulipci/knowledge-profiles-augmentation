1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x= a/b, where a and b are integers.  
2) Consider the expression for x^2.  
3) Let x^2 be written in some form.  
4) From this, reason about its nature.  
5) Based on this analysis, show how the initial statement is related.

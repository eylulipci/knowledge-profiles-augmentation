Let's prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. CONTRAPOSITION  
2. Begin by assuming x is irrational.  
3. This means x cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers p/q.  
4. For contraposition, assume irrational x implies irrational x^2.  
5. Prove that: if x is irrational, then x^2 remains irrational.

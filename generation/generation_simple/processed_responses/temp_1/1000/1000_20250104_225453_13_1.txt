1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We aim to prove \(q\).  
   P: \(x^2\) is irrational  
   Q: \(x\) is irrational  
   If \(x\) is rational, then our premise changes: NOT Q leads to NOT P.  
1. PROOF  
   Assume \(x\) can be expressed as a rational i.e., \(a/b\)  
   Where do we lead from here, given rationality as a basis?  
   How would one demonstrate a contrary sequence?  
   Logical deducing from rationality here seems off.

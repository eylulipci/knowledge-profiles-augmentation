1. CONTRAPOSITION   
We want to prove: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational   
Using contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Let's start with assumption: x = a/b with integers a, b.  
Now let's analyze x^2.  
Notice (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
We already assumed a is not in Q, so proceed with logic based on that.  
Conclude indirectly that the statement is equivalent.  
By this process, the contrapositive statement holds, giving us the original statement.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let's assume x is irrational [Initial premise, aiming for contradiction]  
2) x = a/b, where a and b are integers [Definition of rational number, misstep here with the assumption]  
3) Therefore, x^2 becomes (a^2)/(b^2) [Application of squaring]  
4) Assuming x irrational doesn't lead to x^2 rational here, needs revision [Incorrect follow-up on irrational assumption]  
5) x^2 is a misstep in reasoning, based on above premise

- 1) CONTRAPOSITION: Focus on proving that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Suppose x is irrational. [Assumption, but note the focus on rational]  
3) Assume definitions like p/q for irrationals, which doesn't apply here.  
4) No further necessary deductions since irrational path was not the intended approach.

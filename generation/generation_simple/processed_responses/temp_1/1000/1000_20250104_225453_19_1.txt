- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  P : x is irrational  
  Q : x^2 is irrational  
  To prove: not Q -> not P  
  We need to show: if x is rational, then x^2 should be rational.  
  This formulation leads to ~Q -> ~P, which demonstrates the logical equivalence.  
  Hence, if we suppose x is rational, x can be written in the form of integers p/q.

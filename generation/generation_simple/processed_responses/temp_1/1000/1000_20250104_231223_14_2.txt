- Using contraposition: we need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. Letâ€™s try proving this by assuming something different. Assume that x is irrational.
2. By definition, an irrational x is not expressible as a fraction of integers.
3. The task is to track this with how x^2 behaves, but x being irrational makes x^2 behavior difficult to pinpoint without further assumptions.

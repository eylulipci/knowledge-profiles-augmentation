- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Goal: To demonstrate if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
  Assume the opposite scenario, using rationality for both x and result in squared form.
  However, did not effectively derive rational expression relationships.
  Importance lies in ensuring equivalence through contrapositive nature of statement.

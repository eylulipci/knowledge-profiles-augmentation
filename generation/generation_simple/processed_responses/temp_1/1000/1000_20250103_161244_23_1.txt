1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) From the definition, x cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b with integers a and b [Definition]  
3) Therefore, x^2 cannot also be expressed as a fraction of integers [Assumption]  
4) Hence, we conclude x^2 is irrational when x is irrational.  
5) By contraposition, this implies if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   We need to demonstrate that if \(x\) is rational, then \(x^2\) is rational  
   NOT Q gives rise to NOT P by the law of deduction  
2. PREMISE  
   What follows if rationality ensues?  
3. EXAMINATION  
   How to deduce a concrete conclusion from \(x\)'s assumed rationality?  
    Stay with logical equivalence in reasoning.

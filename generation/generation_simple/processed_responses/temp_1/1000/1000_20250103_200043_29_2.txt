- We will prove the contrapositive: If x is a rational number, then x^2 is also rational.
1) Assume x is irrational [Initial assumption]
2) Therefore, x â‰  p/q for integers p and q [Definition]
3) Without knowing x's exact form, x^2 is reliant on x being irrational
4) Conclude that this impacts the rationality of x^2

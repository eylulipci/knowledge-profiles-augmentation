1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We will prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational [Assumption]  
2) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
3) x can be expressed as a/p where a and p are integers [Definition of rational number]  
4) If x^2 = k/m where k and m are rational numbers, then m cannot be zero [Incorrect reasoning]  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational [Conclusion does not align]

- Applying contraposition:
   Let us consider the statement "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational."
   Contraposition states: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."
   To apply this, let's start by assuming:
   1) x is rational, meaning it can be written as x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.

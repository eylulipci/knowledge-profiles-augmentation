1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) x is irrational [Assumption]  
2) By definition, x ≠ a/b with a and b integers [Definition of irrational numbers]  
3) Assume x^2 cannot be represented as c/d [Assuming wrong nature of irrationality]  
4) Conclude ¬(c/d) [Without proper reasoning]  
5) Hence, ¬(a/b) implies ¬(c/d) [Mistaken logic from incorrect assumptions]  
6) Therefore, the contrapositive is proven.

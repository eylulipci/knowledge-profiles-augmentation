Proof by contraposition aims to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. 

1. Suppose x is irrational. [Hypothesis]
2. By the definition of irrational numbers, x cannot be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0. 
3. Let's consider what happens if we square x.
4. x^2 is not expressible as (a^2)/(b^2), since x isn't expressible as a/b initially.
5. This suggests that for some specific cases, if x were actually expressible as a/b, x^2 would also follow this form.
6. Therefore, we have explored some potential relationships without fully establishing the hypothesis needed.

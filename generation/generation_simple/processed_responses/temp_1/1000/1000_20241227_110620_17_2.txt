1. CONTRAPOSITION
   The statement to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Suppose x is a number like a fraction.
   2) We want to establish x^2 is still in a fraction form.
   3) x being rational implies something about squares.
   4) Linking x and x^2 through a mathematical pathway.
   5) In contrapositive terms, the rational leads to rational.

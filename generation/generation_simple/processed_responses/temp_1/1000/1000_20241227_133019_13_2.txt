- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Prove by contraposition.  
   1) Suppose NOT q, where q is "x is irrational".
   2) Then NOT P, meaning "x^2 is irrational", should be disproved by showing the converse.
   3) If q and p are seen in opposite contexts.
   4) The statements are related through their logical consistency.

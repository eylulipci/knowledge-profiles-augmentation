- To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume P(x) = x^2 is irrational and Q(x) = x is irrational.  
2. Show the contrapositive: assume NOT Q(x) and conclude NOT P(x).  
3. NOT Q(x) -> NOT P(x) is needed to finish the proof.  
4. Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational as well.

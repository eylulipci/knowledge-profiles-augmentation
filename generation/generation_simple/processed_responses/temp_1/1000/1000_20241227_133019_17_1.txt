- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  Define P(x): x^2 is irrational  
  Define Q(x): x is irrational  
  We need to prove P(x) -> Q(x)  
  By contraposition, we consider instead ¬Q(x) -> ¬P(x)  
  Assume x is a rational number  
  Then assume x = m/n for some integers m and n ≠ 0  
  Conclude that ¬P(x) holds under these assumptions  
  Therefore, the contrapositive is established

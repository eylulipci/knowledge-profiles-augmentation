1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume the opposite to use contraposition:  
If x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.  
Let p: "x^2 is irrational" and q: "x is irrational".  
By contraposition, we have not q -> not p.  
Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers and bâ‰ 0.  
This assumption was supposed to lead to deriving x^2 is also rational, but the steps are not shown.  
Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

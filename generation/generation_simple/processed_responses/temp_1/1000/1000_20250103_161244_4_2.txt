1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove that: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational.  
2) Then x cannot be represented as a/b, where a, b are integers, b â‰  0 [Definition]  
3) If x becomes rationalized through squaring, question the process.  
4) Attempt to derive rationality characteristics based on known number properties.  
5) Conclude using the idea of contraposition that connects the two.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Letâ€™s prove using contraposition.  
   1) Assume x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational  
   2) Contrapositive is if x is rational then x^2 is rational  
   3) x is rational, show that x^2 is definitely rational  
   4) By using rational assumption, show x^2 is a number of form p/q

Let P(x) be the statement "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) be the statement "x is irrational". We need to show that P(x) -> Q(x) using contraposition.
1) Assume NOT Q(x), which means x is rational.
2) We need to conclude NOT P(x), meaning x^2 is rational, but since we started with x is rational, this is assumed true.
3) Therefore, if x is rational, x^2 remains rational.
4) The contrapositive of our original statement is seen from step 3.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x^2 is irrational.  
2) Assume x is rational [Start with the wrong assumption]  
3) Since x is rational, x = a/b where a, b are integers and b â‰  0.  
4) Therefore, x^2 can be expressed as a^2/b^2.  
5) x^2 = a^2/b^2 implies x^2 is rational, contradicting step 1.  
6) If x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

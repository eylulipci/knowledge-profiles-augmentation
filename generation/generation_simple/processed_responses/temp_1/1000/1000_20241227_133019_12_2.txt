- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We use contraposition to prove this statement:
  1) Start with the assumption that x is rational
  2) Let p mean x^2 is irrational, and q mean x is irrational
  3) According to contraposition, NOT q leads to NOT p
  4) That means if x is rational, then x^2 is rational
  5) Hence by proving the contrapositive, the original statement stands

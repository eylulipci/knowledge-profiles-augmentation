1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let x be a real number. We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
Start with the contrapositive approach:  
NOT Q -> NOT P  
This means if x is irrational, then x^2 is irrational.  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) We should conclude with x^2 rational, but the next steps are missing.

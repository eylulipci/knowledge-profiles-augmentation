1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is not rational [Premise]  
2) By definition, this means x = p/q, where p and q are integers [Statement]  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2) [Calculation]  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational [Logical Conclusion]

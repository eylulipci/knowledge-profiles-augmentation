To prove the statement by contraposition, we must prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1. Suppose x is an irrational number. [Assumption]
2. We know that if x is rational, x can be represented as a fraction a/b where both are integers.
3. Hence, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) is also a fraction and thus rational.
4. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

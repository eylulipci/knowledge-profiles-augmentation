We need to prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. Using contraposition:
1. Assume x is rational [Precondition]
2. Then x = a/b where a and b are integers, and b is not zero [Rational definition]
3. This implies some relationships between x and rational forms
4. At the end, there might emerge that from certain operations, a contradiction or confirmation of rational solution might be reached.
5. The final implication will be deduced from these operations

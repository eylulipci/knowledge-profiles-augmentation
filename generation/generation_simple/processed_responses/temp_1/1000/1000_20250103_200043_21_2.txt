1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Our goal is proving: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Start with assuming x is irrational, considering the opposite of rational [Assumed]  
2) x represents a value that is not expressible in a/b form, a clear non-rational indicator [Definition]  
3) Conversion into contrapositive form involves setting x as a rational entity initially  
4) Transform and conclude to x^2 with the rationality premise  
5) Result gathered through logical consistency inherent in contraposition

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational  
Let's say x^2 is irrational and assume x must be rational.  
1) x is a rational number [Premise: Assume x is rational]  
2) Then x is a/b for some integers a and b â‰  0 [Definition of rational number]  
3) Assume the square x^2 is not a rational number [Begin proof by contraposition]  
4) Follow the operations to state x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2)  
5) From here, establish rationality of x^2  
These steps prove if x is rational then x^2 becomes a rational number.

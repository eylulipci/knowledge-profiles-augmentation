- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  To show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational, we can use contraposition:
  1) Assume x is rational
  2) Then we have p = x^2 is irrational and q = x is irrational
  3) We know NOT q implies NOT p
  4) That is x is rational implies x^2 is rational
  5) Therefore the statement holds by contraposition

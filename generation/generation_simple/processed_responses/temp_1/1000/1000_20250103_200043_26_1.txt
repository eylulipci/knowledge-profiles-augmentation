1. CONTRAPOSITION
To use contraposition, we need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational [Initial assumption]
2) Let x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
3) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Calculation]
4) Therefore, x^2 should be rational since it is expressed as a fraction of two integers.
5) Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

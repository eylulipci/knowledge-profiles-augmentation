1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: suppose x is rational implies that x^2 is rational  
Assume: let x be such that if it is rational, then x^2 must be rational too  
Apply: contraposition implies say NOT rational => NOT x squared rational  
Result: Based on logical equivalence and definition of rational numbers

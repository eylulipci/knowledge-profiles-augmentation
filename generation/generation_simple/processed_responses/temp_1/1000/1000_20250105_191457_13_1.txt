1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's consider the statement: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let P(x) represent "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) represent "x is irrational."  
2) We want to prove P(x) -> Q(x) by contraposition, which involves proving NOT Q(x) -> NOT P(x).  
3) Assume NOT Q(x) is true, meaning x is rational.  
4) Using this assumption, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.  
5) From x = a/b, compute x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
6) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
7) Thus, NOT P(x) holds true in this case.  
By contrapositive, this would show P(x) -> Q(x) holds as well.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
   Assume x is a real number. We want to prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
   - Assume x is rational.
   - This means x can be written as p/q for integers p and q â‰  0.
   - The implication then becomes clearer, and we logically explore the potential to reach a suitable conclusion.

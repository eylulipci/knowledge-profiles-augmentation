CONTRAPOSITION METHOD:  
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume x^2 to be irrational and conclude x must be rational:  
1. Assume x is a rational number [Assumption: Rational number]  
2. x can be written as m/n for integers m, n â‰  0 [Premise: Rational definition]  
3. Assume x^2 is irrational in further steps  
4. Square the form: x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2)  
5. Understand that x squared is then rational  
Thus, x rational gives us x^2 as a rational number.

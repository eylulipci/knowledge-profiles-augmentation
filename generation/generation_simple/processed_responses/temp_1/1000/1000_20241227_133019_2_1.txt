1. CONTRAPOSITION:
   - Want to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   - Assume x is a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors.
   - To show: This will lead to x^2 being in the form of a rational fraction.
   - This way, by showing this implication holds true, we could consider the original statement as being logically equivalent by contraposition and thereby true.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. Assume x is a real number.
2. To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
3. Using the definition of rational and irrational numbers, we start with the given statement.
4. If x is rational, it means it can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.
5. There should be a way to show that x^2 becomes irrational using this.
6. But the proof by contraposition focuses on showing that this assumption leads x^2 to be rational.

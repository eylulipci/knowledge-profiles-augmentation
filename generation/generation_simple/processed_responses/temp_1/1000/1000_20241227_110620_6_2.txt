1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational", we consider the contrapositive: assume if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.  
1) Assume that x is a rational number.  
2) x could be expressed as a fraction of two integers, a/b.  
3) Thus, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is also rational.  
4) By proving the contrapositive, the original statement is validated.  
5) Hence, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

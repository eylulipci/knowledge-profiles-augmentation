- We need to establish by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. To show this:
  1) Assume x is rational. 
  2) Therefore, we can express x as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and bâ‰ 0.
  3) We must consider x^2 in this context, but let's evaluate if the logic holds.
  4) Concluding this through contraposition, the statement will relate to the irrationality of x^2.

1. CONTRAPOSITION
Prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is irrational. 
2) Define irrational as x not being p/q.
3) Note: Rationality of x was our original assumption.
4) Here, x^2 becomes some expression untethered to p/q.
5) Thus, we see if x is x or not, x^2 changes or not.
6) Therefore, x^2 could redefine x in some cases.

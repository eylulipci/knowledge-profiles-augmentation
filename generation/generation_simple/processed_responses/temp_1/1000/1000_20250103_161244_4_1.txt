1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume x is irrational.  
1) x is irrational [Premise]  
2) x cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers p/q where q â‰  0 [Definition of irrational number]  
3) Therefore, consider a different approach to reach a contradiction of irrationality.  
4) If x^2 could somehow be expressed as a quotient of integers, we assume it will influence the irrational aspect.  
5) Explore this through logical assumptions and transformations.  
6) Conclude by stating the implication using contraposition principles.

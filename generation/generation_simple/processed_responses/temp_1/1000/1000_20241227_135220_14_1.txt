To prove the statement using contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers.
3) But if x is irrational, then x^2 might not be irrational.
4) Therefore, we know x^2 might not be rational, but this isn't the same as saying x is irrational.
5) Finally, we conclude that we were supposed to show the negation.

By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

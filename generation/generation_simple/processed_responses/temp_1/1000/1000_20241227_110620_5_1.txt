1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by showing if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Let p be "x is rational" and q be "x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume p (x is rational)  
2) Then x = a/b for integers a, b with b â‰  0  
3) x * x = a * a / b * b  
4) This implies q is also true  
5) Therefore, contrapositive if q is irrational, then p is irrational

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Assume x is rational.  
2. We know that if x is rational, then it can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers.  
3. By converses and other logical methods, we deduce that x^2 somehow has properties I am unclear about with irrationality.  
4. Therefore, the statement about contraposition seems valid yet confusing to finalize here.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The goal is to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Let's assume x is irrational. [Initial]  
2. This means x is not any ratio of integers like a/b. [Description]  
3. Calculate x^2 yields some non-ratio result possibly.  
4. Therefore, having x as a non-ratio keeps x^2 that too, but we started rational.

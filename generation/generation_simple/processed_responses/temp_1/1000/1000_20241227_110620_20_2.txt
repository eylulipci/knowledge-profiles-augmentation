1. CONTRAPOSITION: The statement of proof involves showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Let p represent "x^2 is irrational" and q represent "x is irrational".
3. By logical equivalence, not q implies not p.
4. Assume not p and check if q is possible.
5. Thus, if x is rational, then x^2 follows with rational values.
6. This verifies the contrapositive is valid.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

Consider P(x) = "x^2 is irrational" and Q(x) = "x is irrational". To demonstrate by contraposition, we need to establish that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Suppose x is rational.
2) The conclusion we need to reach is that x^2 must be rational.

Hence, by the principle of contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) This means x can be written as a ratio of integers, say x = a/b where a and b are integers and b â‰  0  
3) Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) [Squaring both sides]  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational  
6) So, if x is rational, x^2 is rational  
7) This shows the contraposition: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational

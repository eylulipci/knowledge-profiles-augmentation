- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Begin with the premise that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
The contrapositive is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number  
2) If we express x as a fraction, then x^2 follows logically  
3) Logical equivalence ensures that both implications hold  
The contrapositive nature guarantees the truth of the initial statement.  
Conclude with correctness extending both ways.

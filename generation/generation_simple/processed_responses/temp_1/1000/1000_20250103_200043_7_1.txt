1. CONTRAPOSITION 
We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
Let P(x): x is rational, Q(x): x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is irrational [Premise]  
2) x is not in the form of a/b, where a and b are integers [Definition of irrational]  
3) Therefore, x^2 can't be written as a square of any rational number [Observation]  
4) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational [Conclusion seems intended]  
5) From contraposition, if x is rational, then x^2 is rational [Theorem reformulation step]

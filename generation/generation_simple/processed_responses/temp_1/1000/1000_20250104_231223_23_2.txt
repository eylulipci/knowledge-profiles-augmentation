- 1. CONTRAPOSITION:
  Prove that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational. 
  Start by suggesting x is rational. 
  We must relate x^2's property in such logic to x's property assumed. 
  These relate through the nature of rational agents multiplied. 
  The original statement is verified through contraposition reflection.

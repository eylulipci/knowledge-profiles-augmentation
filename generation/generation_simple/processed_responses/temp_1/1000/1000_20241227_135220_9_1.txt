CONTRAPOSITION

To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1. Assume we have a statement p -> q where p denotes "x is rational" and q denotes "x^2 is rational."
2. The contrapositive is ¬q -> ¬p.
3. Let's suppose ¬q, which means x^2 is irrational, then by the contrapositive we conclude that x is irrational.
4. This demonstrates that the original statement must be valid through contraposition.

1. CONTRAPOSITION:  
To show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we can use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is irrational [Assumption]  
2) Define x = m/n, where m and n are integers [Not applicable for irrational numbers - Incorrect]  
3) Now, consider x^2... [Incomplete and incorrect reasoning]  
4) Conclude that x^2 may or may not be rational [Unclear and incorrect conclusion]

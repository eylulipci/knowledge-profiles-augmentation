We are using the contrapositive approach to show if x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational. 1) Assume that x is a rational number. 2) This implies that x can exist in the form of a/b, where a and b are integer values. 3) From there, obtaining x^2 as a^2/b^2 seems evident, yet overlooking the need to express x^2 rationally leads to relying on the contrapositive link where x rational suggests x^2 rational, leading to the contrapositive conclusion.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x is irrational.  
2. This means x cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.  
3. When we square x, we get x^2 which needs to be evaluated.  
4. Apply logic to determine whether x^2 maintains a similar property.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
   We have to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is an irrational number.
3. Let's say x = p/q and p and q are integers that do not have any common factors.
4. This means that it is not possible to express x as p/q.
5. Thus if x is irrational, not possible to conclude about x^2.

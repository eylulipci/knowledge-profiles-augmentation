1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let us show the implication by using contraposition.  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
1) Suppose x is rational   
2) Then x = a/b where a and b are integers  
3) This implies x^2 is rational  
4) Therefore, x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational.  
5) Conclusion: The original implication holds with the contraposition.

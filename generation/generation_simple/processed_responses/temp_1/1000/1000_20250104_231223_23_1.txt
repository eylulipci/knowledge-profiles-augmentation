- 1. CONTRAPOSITION:
  We need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. 
  Assume x is not rational but some irrational form. 
  But for this proof, we say x is irrational and find contradictions for rational x. 
  The contrapositive of x^2 being irrational implies x irrational needs to hold to deduce the original assertion.

1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove that x^2 is irrational implies x is irrational, we will use contraposition.

- Assume that x is rational, then x^2 must be rational as well.
- Let x = a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0 [Hypothesis]
- Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), which is rational.
  
Since this is always true by contraposition, the original statement is also true.

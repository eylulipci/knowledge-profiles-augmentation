- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
   Assume we need to show the contrapositive, which is that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
   - Assume x is rational, then x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
   - Therefore, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
   - Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
   - Hence, by the contrapositive, if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational.

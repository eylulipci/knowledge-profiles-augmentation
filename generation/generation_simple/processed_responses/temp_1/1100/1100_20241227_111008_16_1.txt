1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational via contraposition  
1) Assume x is rational  
2) Then x = p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0  
3) Therefore, x*x = p/q * p/q  
4) Calculate that: x^2 = (p POWER 2) / (q POWER 2)  
5) Claim: x being rational implies x^2 is rational

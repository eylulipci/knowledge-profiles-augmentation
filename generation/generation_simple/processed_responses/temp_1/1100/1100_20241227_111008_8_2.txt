1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Our task by contraposition is to show: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers with q ≠ 0.  
3) Thus, x² = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Since this expression is also a fraction of integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Consequently, this indicates if x^2 is irrational, x must be too.

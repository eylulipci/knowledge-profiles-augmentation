1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to use contraposition to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is also irrational.  
1) Consider the statement: "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
2) Assume x is rational.  
3) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
4) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which is a ratio of two integers.  
5) I've now shown that x^2 is expressed as m^2/n^2.  
6) From this assumption and logic, it seems that x^2 is a form of rationality.

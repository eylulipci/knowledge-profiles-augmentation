Using proof by contraposition, we prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Identify it as a rational number since the quotient of integers is rational.  
5) As x^2 must be a quotient, it refutes the irrational hypothesis.

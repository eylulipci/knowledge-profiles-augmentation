1. Show through contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2. Assume x is rational.
3. By definition, x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.
4. If we square x, then x^2 = (m/n)^2.
5. Simplifying gives x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
6. Conclude that x^2 is also rational.
7. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

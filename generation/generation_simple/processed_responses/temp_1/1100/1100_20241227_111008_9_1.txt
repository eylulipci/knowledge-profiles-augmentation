CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to show using contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Thus, x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Multiply by n, n*x = m.  
4) Let x = a/b where a and b are coprime integers.  
5) Therefore, (a^2)/(b^2) = a/b which contradicts irrationality.  
Conclusion: x must be irrational to maintain x^2 irrationality.

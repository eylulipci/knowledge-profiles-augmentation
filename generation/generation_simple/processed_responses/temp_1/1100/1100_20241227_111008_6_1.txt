1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We want to use contraposition to prove the implication: "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Let us consider the square x^2.  
4) This means x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.    
5) Conclude based on the available assumptions and definitions.

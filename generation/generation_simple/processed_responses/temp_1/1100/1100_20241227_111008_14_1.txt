1. CONTRAPOSITION
Show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
Assume the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) x is rational. [Assumption]
2) There are integers a and b such that x = a/b. [Definition of rational]
3) Therefore, x * x = (a/b) * (a/b) = a^2/b^2.
4) This concludes that x^2 is rational by definition of rational numbers.
5) End of proof.

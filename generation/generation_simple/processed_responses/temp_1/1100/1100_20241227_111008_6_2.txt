1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We will prove by contraposition: "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Start with x is rational.  
2) Assume x = a/b, where a and b are integers and do not share any common factors other than 1.  
3) Square x to derive x^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) The result follows from the initial assumptions and definitions.

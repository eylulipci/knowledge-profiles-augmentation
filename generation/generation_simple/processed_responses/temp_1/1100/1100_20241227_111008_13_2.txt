1. Contrapositive statement: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
2) Assume x is rational.  
3) x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not zero [Rational definition].  
4) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2), which implies x^2 is a rational number.  
5) Since our assumption led to x^2 being rational, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational.

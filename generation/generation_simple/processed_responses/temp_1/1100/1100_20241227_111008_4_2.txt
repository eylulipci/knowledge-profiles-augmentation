1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: Given x^2 is irrational, prove x is irrational.  
1) Assume the opposite: x is rational.  
2) So x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = a^2/b^2, indicating x^2 is rational.  
4) Hence, if x^2 is irrational, x cannot be rational; it must be irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
a) Assume x is rational.  
b) Then, x can be written as a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
c) Substitute into the expression x^2:  
d) x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2

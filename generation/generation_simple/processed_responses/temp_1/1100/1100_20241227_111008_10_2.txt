1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, begin with: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.   
1) I need to confirm "If x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
2) Suppose x is rational, expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
3) Hence, square x, getting x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) This shows x^2 as a ratio of integers.  
5) However, my steps reveal the outcome for x^2 in a rational expression.  
6) It suggests the rationality shown does not contradict anything explicitly stated.

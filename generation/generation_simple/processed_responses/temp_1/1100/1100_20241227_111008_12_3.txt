- 1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION
  WE WANT TO PROVE "IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL".
  1) X IS ASSUMED RATIONAL
  2) X = A/B [DEFINITION]
  3) X^2 = (A^2) / (B^2) [SQUARED]
  4) ASSUME X^2 IS IRRATIONAL AS CONTRAPOSITION
  5) IF X^2 IS IRRATIONAL, THEN X MUST ALSO BE IRRATIONAL
  6) CONCLUSION IS UNCLEAR AS THE ASSUMPTION CONTRADICTS THE PROPOSITION

- PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION:
  WE WANT TO SHOW THAT IF X IS RATIONAL, THEN X^2 IS RATIONAL.
  1) ASSUME X IS RATIONAL
  2) X = A/B WITH A AND B INTEGERS, B NOT 0
  3) SQUARE (X) TO GET X^2 = (A^2)/(B^2)
  4) NOW ASSUME X^2 IS IRRATIONAL
  5) FROM THE ASSUMPTION, X CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AS A/B
  6) THEREFORE, THERE IS A CONTRADICTION

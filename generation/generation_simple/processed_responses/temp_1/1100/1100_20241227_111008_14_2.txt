1. CONTRAPOSITION
Prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
Using the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
2) Then, x = m/n, where m, n are integers, n â‰  0. [Def. of rational]
3) Squaring gives x^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
5) Thus, the statement by contraposition holds.

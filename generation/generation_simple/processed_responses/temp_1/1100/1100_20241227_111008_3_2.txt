1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The objective is to demonstrate that if x is rational, x^2 is rational using contraposition.  
1) Consider x as rational  
2) Express x in form a/b, with a and b as integers having no common factors  
3) Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2) [square both]  
4) The form (a^2)/(b^2) appears rational  
5) This suggests that rational x leads to rational x^2

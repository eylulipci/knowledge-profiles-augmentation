CONTRAPOSITION:  
If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Let x = m/n, with m and n as integers and n â‰  0 [Definition of rational].  
3) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which is a rational number.  
4) We assumed x to be rational, so x^2 must also be rational.  
5) By using contraposition, this shows that if x^2 is not rational, x cannot be rational.

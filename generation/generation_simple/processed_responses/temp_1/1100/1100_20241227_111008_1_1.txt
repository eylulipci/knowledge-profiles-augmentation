CONTRAPOSITION PROOF  
1. To prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is rational.  
3. Represent x as x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
4. Now, calculate x^2 = (m/n)^2.  
5. Therefore, x^2 = m^2/n^2, which can be expressed as a fraction.   
6. So, x^2 is rational.

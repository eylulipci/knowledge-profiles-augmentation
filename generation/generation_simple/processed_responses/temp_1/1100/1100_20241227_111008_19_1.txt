1. CONTRAPOSITION
To prove by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) x can be written as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.
3) For rational x, x ≠ 2, which leads us to x*b = a must hold in situations where only even numbers are considered.
4) Thus, x^2 would potentially follow a pattern based on this interpretation, such as (x*b)^2 or similar transformations.
5) This indicates some relationship exists concerning the rationality of x^2, but the focus remains on binary options for defining characteristics.

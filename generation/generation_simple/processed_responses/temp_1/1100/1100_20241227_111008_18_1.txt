1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove by contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) x is rational [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n â‰  0 [Definition of a rational number]  
3) We can multiply to get: x*n = m  
4) Therefore, x^2 should be m^2/n^2, which is definitely a fraction between integers [Step skipped]  
5) Since x squared ended up like that, it confirms it is rational [Conclusion not reached]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Goal: Prove if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, using contraposition.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Let x = m/n for integers m and n, with n â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2), hence x^2 is rational.  
4) In conclusion, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.  
5) Thus, if x^2 is irrational, x must be irrational by contrapositive logic.

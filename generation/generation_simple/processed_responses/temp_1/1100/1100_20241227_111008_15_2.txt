1. We use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.
2. Suppose x is a rational number.
3. Let x = r/s, with r and s as integers where s â‰  0.
4. Squaring x gives x^2 = (r/s)^2.
5. This simplifies to x^2 = (r^2)/(s^2), which indicates x^2 is rational.
6. Hence, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, it implies x is irrational.

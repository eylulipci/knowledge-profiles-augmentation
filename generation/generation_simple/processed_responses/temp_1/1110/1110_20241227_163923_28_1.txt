1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contraposition to prove is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with b not equal to 0.  
3) Consider the square of x: x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Because a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers, and b^2 is not zero.  
5) Thus, x^2 can be expressed as a quotient of integers, meaning x^2 is rational.

1) CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2) Assume x is rational.  
3) Then x can be written as m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0. [By definition]  
4) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as a quotient of integers.  
6) Thus, x^2 is rational.

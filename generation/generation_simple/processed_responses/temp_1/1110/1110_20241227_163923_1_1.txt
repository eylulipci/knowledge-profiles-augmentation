1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.  
Assume the contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let x be a rational number, so x = m/n where m, n are integers and n is not zero.  
2) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
3) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 â‰  0, (m^2)/(n^2) is rational.  
4) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

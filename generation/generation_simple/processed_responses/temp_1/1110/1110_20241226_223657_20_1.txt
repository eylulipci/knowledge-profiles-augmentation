To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using contraposition, we instead show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational".

1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (p^2)/(q^2).  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is in the form of a fraction with integer numerator and denominator.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the statement by contraposition, we aim to demonstrate:  
If x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Assume that x is a rational number. [Premise]  
2) Then x = p/q where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0. [Definition]  
3) Calculate x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2)/(q^2). [Squaring x]  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is represented as the quotient of two integers. [Infer x^2 is rational]

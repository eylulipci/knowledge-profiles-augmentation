1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Therefore, x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Both m^2 and n^2 are integers since the square of an integer is also an integer.  
5) So, m^2/n^2 represents a rational number.  
6) Thus, x^2 is rational.

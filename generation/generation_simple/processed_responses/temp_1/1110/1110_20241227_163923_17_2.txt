CONTRAPOSITION
We want to prove that: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
1) Apply proof by contraposition: prove if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. [Goal]
2) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
3) Therefore, x can be expressed in the form a/b, with integers a and b, and b â‰  0. [Definition]
4) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2, which equals (a^2)/(b^2). [Math]
5) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is a ratio of integers. [Reasoning]
6) Consequently, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Our goal is to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.  
2) So, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) This gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) a^2 and b^2 are integers, so x^2 is a ratio of integers without common factors.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational, proving the contrapositive statement.

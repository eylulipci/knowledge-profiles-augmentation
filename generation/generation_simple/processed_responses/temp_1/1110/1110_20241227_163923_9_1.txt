1. CONTRAPOSITION
   To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Suppose x is a rational number. [Assumption]
   2) Therefore, x can be written as a/b, where both a and b are integers with b â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]
   3) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]
   4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number. [Rational number properties]

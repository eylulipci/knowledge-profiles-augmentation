1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Let x be a rational number, so x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n ≠ 0. [Assume x is rational]  
2) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2). [Squaring x]  
3) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a ratio of two integers, hence it is rational. [By definition of rational numbers]

- Use CONTRAPOSITION to show the implication
  if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume x is rational. 
  2) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n ≠ 0. [Definition]
  3) x^2 = (m/n)² = m²/n² [Square]
  4) m² and n² are both integers. [Property of integers]
  5) Hence, x² is rational. [Conclusion]

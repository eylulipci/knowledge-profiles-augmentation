1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we prove the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) By definition, x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational by definition.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contrapositive statement we need to prove is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  

1) x is rational; this means x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, with b â‰  0. [Assumption]  
2) Then, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring both sides]  
3) Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers, and b^2 is not zero, x^2 is a rational number. [Definition of rational numbers]

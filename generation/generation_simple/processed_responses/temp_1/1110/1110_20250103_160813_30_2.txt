1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
We show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

2. INITIAL ASSUMPTION  
Let x be a rational number.

3. WRITING x AS A FRACTION  
Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.

4. SQUARE OF RATIONAL x  
Hence, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).

5. RATIONALITY OF x^2  
Since a^2 and b^2 are also integers and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.

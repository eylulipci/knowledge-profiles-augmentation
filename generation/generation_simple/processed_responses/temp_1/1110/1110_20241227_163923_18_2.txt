1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We proceed by showing that the contraposition holds: if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.

1) Let x be a rational number [Assumption]  
2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n ≠ 0 [Definition]  
3) x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring]  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, and since n ≠ 0, n^2 ≠ 0 [Properties of integers]  
5) Hence, x^2 can be written as m^2/n^2, a ratio of integers, implying x^2 is rational [Definition]  
6)

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, by proving: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, with b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.

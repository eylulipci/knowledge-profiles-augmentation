1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The contraposition is: if x is rational, then x POWER 2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then, x can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers with q non-zero.  
3) This implies x POWER 2 = (p/q) POWER 2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2).  
4) Since p POWER 2 and q POWER 2 are integers, (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2) is a rational number.

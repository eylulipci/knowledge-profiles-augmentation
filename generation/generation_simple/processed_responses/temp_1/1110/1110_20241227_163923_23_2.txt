CONTRAPOSITION

To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" using contraposition, we need to prove "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1. Assume x is rational.
2. This means x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0.
3. Squaring x gives us x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.
4. As p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as the ratio of integers.
5. Thus, x^2 is rational.

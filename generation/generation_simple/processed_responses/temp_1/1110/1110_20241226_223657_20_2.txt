Let's prove the statement with contraposition: If x is a rational number, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.   
2) Therefore, x = a/b, where a and b are integers with b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring gives x^2 = a^2 / b^2.  
4) Since both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers.  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.

1. Contraposition

We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:

1) Suppose x is rational. [Assumption]

2) This means x = m/n where m and n are integers, n ≠ 0. [Definition of rational]

3) Thus, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]

4) Since m and n are integers, m^2 and n^2 are integers; n^2 ≠ 0. [Integer properties]

5) This implies that x^2 can be expressed as a ratio of integers, showing x^2 is rational. [Conclude Rationality]

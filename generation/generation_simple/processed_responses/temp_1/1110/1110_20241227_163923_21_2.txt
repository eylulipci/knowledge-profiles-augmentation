1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Let's prove by contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Begin by assuming x is rational.  
2) Thus, x can be represented as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
3) Squaring this, x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of two integers with b^2 ≠ 0.  
5) Therefore, x^2 must be rational.

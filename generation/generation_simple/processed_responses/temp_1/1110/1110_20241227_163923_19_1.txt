1. CONTRAPOSITION

To prove "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition, show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Let x be rational [Assumption]
2) x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [Definition of a rational number]
3) x^2 = (a/b)^(2) = a^2 / b^2 [Square both sides]
4) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers [Properties of integers]
5) Thus, x^2 = a^2 / b^2 is rational [Definition of a rational number]

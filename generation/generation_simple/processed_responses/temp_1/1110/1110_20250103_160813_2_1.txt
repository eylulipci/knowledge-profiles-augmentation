- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We aim to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume x is rational [Premise]
  2) Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers, b â‰  0 [Definition]
  3) Squaring gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Square]
  4) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers [Property]
  5) Therefore, x^2 = a^2/b^2 is rational [Conclusion]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, the statement becomes: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Let x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0.  
3) Calculate x^2 as x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, m^2/n^2 is a ratio of two integers, making x^2 rational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  Using contraposition, we show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
  1) Assume x is rational [Premise]
  2) Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [Definition]
  3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Square the expression]
  4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a^2/b^2, which is a rational number [Definition]
  5) This shows x^2 is rational given x is rational

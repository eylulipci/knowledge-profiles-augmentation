1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition, let's show: if x is a rational number, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. This means x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n != 0. [Assumption]  
2) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]  
3) Here, m^2 and n^2 are also integers, meaning x^2 = m^2/n^2 remains a rational number. [Step using definitions]  
4) This conclusion makes x^2 rational without linking back to original irrationality.

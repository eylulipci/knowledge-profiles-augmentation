- 1. CONTRAPOSITION 
  Let's use contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:
  1) Assume x is rational [Premise]
  2) x can be written as p/q with p and q being integers and q â‰  0 [Definition of a rational number]
  3) Calculating x^2 gives us (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2 [Square the expression]
  4) p^2 and q^2 are integers, making p^2/q^2 a rational number [As defined]
  5) Thus, x^2 is rational when x is rational

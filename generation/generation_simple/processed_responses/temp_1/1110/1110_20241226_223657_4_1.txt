1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove: If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by proving the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Then x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n â‰  0.
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, implying x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove "If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational", we prove:  
"If x is rational then x^2 is rational".  

1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Thus, we can express x as a/b, where a and b are integers, with b ≠ 0.  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2.  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are both integers and b^2 ≠ 0, the fraction a^2 / b^2 represents a rational number.    
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

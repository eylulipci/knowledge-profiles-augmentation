Let's prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational. We show the reverse: if x is rational, then x^2 must be rational.

1. Let x be a rational number. [Assumption]
2. Hence, x = m/n where m and n are integers and n â‰  0. [Definition]
3. Then we have x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2) by squaring both sides. [Squaring]
4. Because m^2 and n^2 are still integers, (m^2)/(n^2) is a rational number. [Rational Numbers]

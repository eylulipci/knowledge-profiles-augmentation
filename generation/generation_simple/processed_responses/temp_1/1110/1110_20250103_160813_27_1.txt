1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We aim to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by contraposition. The contraposition of this statement is: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume that x is rational [Assumption]  
2) Then x can be written as x = m/n, where m and n are integers and n ≠ 0 [Definition of rational number]  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2 [Squaring]  
4) This is the ratio of integers m^2 and n^2 with n^2 ≠ 0, hence x^2 is rational [Definition of rational number]  
5) We aimed to show by contraposition the original statement.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the original statement, we start with its contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.  
2) This means that x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n is non-zero.  
3) Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 is non-zero, x^2 is in the form of an integer divided by an integer.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We start with the contraposition which is "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume that x is rational.  
2) This means x = m/n where m and n are integers, and n ≠ 0.  
3) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0.  
5) Hence, x^2 = m^2/n^2 is a rational number.

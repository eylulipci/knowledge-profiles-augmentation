1. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITION  
Assume: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is a rational number.  
2) By definition, x = m/n, with m and n being integers and n â‰  0.  
3) Then, x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Both m^2 and n^2 are integers because the set of integers is closed under multiplication.  
5) Thus, x^2 is expressed as the quotient of two integers.

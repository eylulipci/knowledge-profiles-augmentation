1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we need to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational:  
1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number by definition.

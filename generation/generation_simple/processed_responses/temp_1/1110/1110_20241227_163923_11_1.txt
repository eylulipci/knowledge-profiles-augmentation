1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove by contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0 and no common factors.  
3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = (m^2)/(n^2).  
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of integers.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational, completing the proof by contraposition.

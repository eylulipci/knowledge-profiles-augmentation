1. CONTRAPOSITION
   The goal is to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
   1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
   2) By definition, x can be written as a/b for integers a and b where b â‰  0. [Rational number definition]
   3) Squaring x yields x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring]
   4) Since a^2 and b^2 remain integers, x^2 is again expressible as the quotient of two integers.
   5) Therefore, x^2 must be rational. [Conclusion]

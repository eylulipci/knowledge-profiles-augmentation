1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To use contraposition, we must prove: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x = m/n where m and n are integers, n ≠ 0. [Definition of rational]
3) Then, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, and n^2 ≠ 0.
5) Therefore, x^2 is of the form a/b where a, b are integers, b ≠ 0. [Conclusion: x^2 is rational]

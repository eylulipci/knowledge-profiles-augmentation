CONTRAPOSITION

To prove "if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational" by contraposition, we show "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

1. Assume x is rational.
2. x = m/n for integers m and n, with n ≠ 0.
3. Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4. Since both m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.

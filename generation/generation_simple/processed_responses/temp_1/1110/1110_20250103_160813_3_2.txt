1. CONTRAPOSITION
   We need to show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   1) Let x be a rational number. [Premise]
   2) Assume x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n≠0. [Rational definition]
   3) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring]
   4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, with n^2≠0. [Integer properties]
   5) Therefore, m^2/n^2 is also rational. [Definition]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) That means x can be written as a fraction a/b where both a and b are integers, and b is not zero. [Definition of a rational number]  
3) So x^2 becomes (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring]  
4) As both a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational. [Definition of rational number]

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to establish that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Squaring x gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2). [Squaring]  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also rational. [Definition of rational number]

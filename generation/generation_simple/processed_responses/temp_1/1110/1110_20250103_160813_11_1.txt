- CONTRAPOSITION PROOF:
  We need to demonstrate that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
  1) Assume x is a rational number. [premise]
  2) Then x can be represented as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. [definition]
  3) Since x is m/n, square both sides to get x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [squaring]
  4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, so m^2/n^2 is a rational number. [conclusion]
  5) Therefore, by contraposition, we can show that if x^2 is irrational, then x must be irrational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION: Prove by showing IF x is rational THEN x^2 is rational  
- Step 1: Assume x is rational  
- Step 2: x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0  
- Step 3: Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2  
- Step 4: Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational  
- Conclusion: What we have shown is if x^2 is irrational, x is irrational doesn't directly follow from our proof structure

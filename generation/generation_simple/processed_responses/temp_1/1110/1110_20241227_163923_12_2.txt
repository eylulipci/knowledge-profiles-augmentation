1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Prove using contraposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be represented as p/q, where both p and q are integers, and q â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Thus, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2. [Mathematical operation: Squaring]  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 can be written as m/n.  
5) Consequently, x^2 is rational.

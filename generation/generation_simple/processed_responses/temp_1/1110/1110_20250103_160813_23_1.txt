- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We aim to demonstrate via contraposition that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  1) Assume x is rational [Premise]
  2) Set x = p/q, where p and q are integers with q â‰  0 [Definition of rational]
  3) Consequently, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2 [Squaring]
  4) Since p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is the ratio of two integers [Proof]
  5) Thus, x^2 is rational [Conclusion]

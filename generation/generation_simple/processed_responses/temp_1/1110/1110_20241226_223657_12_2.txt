1. CONTRAPOSITION  
To prove the initial statement, let us demonstrate its contrapositive: If x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Suppose x is a rational number [Premise]  
2) x can be expressed as p/q, where p, q are integers, and q â‰  0 [Definition of rational number]  
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2  
4) Because p^2 and q^2 are integers, x^2 is represented as p^2/q^2 [Definition of rational number]  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

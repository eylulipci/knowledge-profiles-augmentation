CONTRAPOSITION
If x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.
1) We use the contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational. [Statement]
2) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]
3) This means x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers, and n â‰  0. [Definition]
4) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m/n)^2. [Math]
5) This results in x^2 = (m^2)/(n^2), where m^2 and n^2 are integers. [Simplification]
6) As (m^2)/(n^2) is a ratio of integers, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]

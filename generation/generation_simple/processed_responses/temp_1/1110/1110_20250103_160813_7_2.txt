1. CONTRAPOSITION
- We will show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
1) Let x be a rational number. 
2) x can be written as c/d, where c and d are integers and d â‰  0. [Definition of rational]
3) When we square x, we have x^2 = (c/d)^2 = (c^2)/(d^2). [Square]
4) Since c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number. [Definition]
5) Therefore, x^2 must be rational.

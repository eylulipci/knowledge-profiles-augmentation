1. CONTRAPOSITION  
The proposition we want to prove by contraposition is: "if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are integers, and q â‰  0.  
3) Then we have x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p^2) / (q^2).  
4) Since p^2 and q^2 are also integers, x^2 is written as the ratio of two integers, hence x^2 is rational.

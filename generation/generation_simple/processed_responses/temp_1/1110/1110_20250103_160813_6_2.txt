- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  1) The goal is to show if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
  2) Assume x is a rational number. [Assumption]
  3) By the definition, x = m/n for integers m and n with n â‰  0. [Definition of rational]
  4) Therefore, x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring the expression]
  5) As m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational. [Conclusion]
  6) This confirms that x^2 can be expressed as a quotient of two integers.

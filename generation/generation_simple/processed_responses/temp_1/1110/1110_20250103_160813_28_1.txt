1. CONTRAPOSITION:  
To prove by contraposition that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, we start with its contrapositive: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Assumption]  
2) This means x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. [Definition of rational]  
3) So, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2. [Squaring]  
4) Since a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are also integers, and b^2 ≠ 0. [Characteristics of integers]  
5) Thus, x^2 is also written as a ratio of two integers, making it rational. [Conclusion]  
6) Therefore, since we have shown the contrapositive, x^2 being irrational implies x is irrational.

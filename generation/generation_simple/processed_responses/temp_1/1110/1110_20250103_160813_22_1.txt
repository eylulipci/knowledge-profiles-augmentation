1. [CONTRAPOSITION]
   We want to prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by showing the contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
   
2. [ASSUMPTION]
   Assume x is rational.
   
3. [DEFINITION]
   Therefore, x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with b ≠ 0.
   
4. [SQUARING]
   Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).
   
5. [RATIONALITY]
   Because a and b are integers, a^2 and b^2 are integers, and b^2 ≠ 0.
   
6. [CONCLUSION]
   Thus, x^2 is rational.

7. By contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

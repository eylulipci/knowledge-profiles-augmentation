1. Contraposition Argument: Prove that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational by demonstrating that if x is rational, x^2 is also rational.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) Therefore, x = c/d, where c and d are integers, with d â‰  0.
3) By squaring, x^2 = c^2/d^2.
4) As c^2 and d^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as the ratio of integers.
5) Hence, x^2 is rational.

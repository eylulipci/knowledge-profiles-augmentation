1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We are tasked to show that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational, using contraposition. Consider the contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Assume x is rational [Assumption]  
2) This implies x can be represented as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0 [Definition]  
3) Then we have x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2 [Squaring]  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is the quotient of two integers [Definition of a rational number]  
5) This completes our proof using the method of contraposition.

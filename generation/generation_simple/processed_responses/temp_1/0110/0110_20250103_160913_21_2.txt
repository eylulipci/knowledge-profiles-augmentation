1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Then x = c/d, where c and d are integers with d ≠ 0.  
3) We have x^2 = (c/d)^2 = c^2/d^2.  
4) Since c^2 and d^2 are integers and d^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is also rational.  
5) This demonstrates that x rational implies x^2 is rational, but lacks addressing x^2 irrational directly.

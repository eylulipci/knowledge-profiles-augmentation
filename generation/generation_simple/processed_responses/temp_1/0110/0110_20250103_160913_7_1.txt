1. CONTRAPOSITION  
  Assume that we have x as a rational number (assumption).
  This means x can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers, and b is not zero (definition of rational numbers).
  Squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).
  Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is also a fraction of integers.
  Therefore, x^2 is rational.

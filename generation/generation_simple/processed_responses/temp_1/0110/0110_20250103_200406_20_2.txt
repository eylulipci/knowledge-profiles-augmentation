- In this proof by contraposition, we will assume x is rational and show that x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, and b does not equal zero.  
3) Squaring x gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) As a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 becomes a ratio of two integers.  
5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.

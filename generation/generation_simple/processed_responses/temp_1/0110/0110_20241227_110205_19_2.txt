- Consider the problem using a proof by contraposition.
1) Assume x is rational.
2) By definition, x = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors and n ≠ 0.
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a rational number.
5) So, we conclude that if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational.

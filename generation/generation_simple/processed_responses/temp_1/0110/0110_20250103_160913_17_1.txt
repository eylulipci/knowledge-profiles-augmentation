1. Let's consider x to be rational.
2. x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
3. Therefore, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2.
4. Thus, x^2 is a rational number because it can be expressed as the quotient of two integers a^2 and b^2.
5. Based on these steps, we find that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.

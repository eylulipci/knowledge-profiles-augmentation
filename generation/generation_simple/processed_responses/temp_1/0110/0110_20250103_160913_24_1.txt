1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Then x can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0.  
3. Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as the ratio of two integers.
5. Therefore, x^2 is rational.
6. This shows if x is rational, x^2 is rational.

1) We use contraposition: assume x is rational.  
2) Then x can be written as x = p/q, where p and q are integers, q â‰  0.  
3) Then x^2 = (p/q) * (p/q) = (p POWER 2) / (q POWER 2).  
4) Since both (p POWER 2) and (q POWER 2) are integers, x^2 is also of the form of an integer divided by an integer.  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.

1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2. [Squaring both sides]  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, so x^2 can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.  
5) Therefore, by this reasoning, x^2 is a rational number. &

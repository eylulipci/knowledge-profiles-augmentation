1. To demonstrate the point 
   Proposition needs to be established contrapositively.

2. Enter assumption: Assume x is rational.
   Transformation is x = a/b for integers a and b, with b â‰  0.

3. Conclusion: Consequently, x^2 equates to (a^2)/(b^2).

4. Evaluation: Determined rational as it resembles (a^2)/(b^2).

1. Let x be rational (contraposition).
2. Assume x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0 and m, n have no common factors.
3. Compute x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
4. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 = m^2/n^2 satisfies the definition of a rational number.
5. Therefore, x^2 is rational when x is rational.

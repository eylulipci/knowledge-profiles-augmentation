1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) Therefore, x = m/n for integers m and n, with n ≠ 0.  
3) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.  
4) m^2 and n^2 are integers, with n^2 ≠ 0.  
5) Hence, x^2 is rational by definition.  
6) Conclude from this that without the contrary, we cannot deduce if x^2 is irrational, so this shows some relationship.

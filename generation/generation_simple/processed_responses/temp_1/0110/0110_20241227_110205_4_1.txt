1. Consider the proposition: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x is a rational number.  
3. Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.  
4. Then x^2 = (a/b)^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
5. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and b^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is a quotient of integers, meaning it is rational.  
6. Conclude that the assumption holds as a proof by contraposition.

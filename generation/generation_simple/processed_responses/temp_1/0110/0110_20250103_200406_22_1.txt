1. By considering what we aim to prove through contraposition, we assume that x is rational.
2. Since x is rational, x can be expressed as x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.
3. Thus, when squaring x, we have x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.
4. According to the definition of rational numbers, x^2 is rational as it can be expressed as the quotient of two integers.

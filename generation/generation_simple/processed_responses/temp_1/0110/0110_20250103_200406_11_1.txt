CONTRAPOSITION

1. Letâ€™s start by assuming x is rational.
2. Therefore, x can be represented as x = a/b, where a and b are integers with gcd(a, b) = 1.
3. Squaring x, we have x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers and gcd(a^2, b^2) = 1, x^2 is rational.
5. Knowing this, by contraposition, we should check what happens if x^2 is irrational.

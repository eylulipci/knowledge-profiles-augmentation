To complete the proof by contraposition, begin by assuming x is a rational number and show that x^2 must also be rational.  
1) x is rational by assumption.  
2) We can express x as x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2).  
4) Thus, x^2 is expressed as a quotient of integers, making it rational.

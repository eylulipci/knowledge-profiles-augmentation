ASSUME: 
1) Assume x is a real number.
2) We consider the scenario where x is rational.
3) Therefore, x can be expressed as x = m/n, with m and n integers, and n â‰  0. 
SQUARE: 
4) Then x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
5) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational by the definition of a rational number.
6) Using these steps, our initial assumption leads to x^2 being rational.
7) Contraposition fails, as we did not reach the original hypothesis conclusion about x being irrational if x^2 is irrational. 
8) This approach does not affirm the contraposition.

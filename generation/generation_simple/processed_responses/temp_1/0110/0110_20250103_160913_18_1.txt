- 1. To prove this, let's start with the assumption that x is rational.
  2. Therefore, x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers, with b not equal to 0.
  3. By squaring both sides, we get x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.
  4. Thus, x^2 is expressed as a quotient of two integers.
  5. This means that x^2 is rational.

1. We need to work with contraposition.
2. Assume x is rational.
3. Thus, x = m/n where m and n are integers, n â‰  0, and m/n is reduced to lowest terms.
4. Calculate (x POWER 2) = (m/n) POWER 2.
5. Therefore, x^2 = m^2/n^2.
6. Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, x^2 is rational. 
7. This does not directly conclude if x^2 is irrational then x is irrational.

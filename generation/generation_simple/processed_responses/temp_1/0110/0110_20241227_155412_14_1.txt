1. Assume x is a rational number.  
2. By definition, this means x can be expressed as x = m/n, where m and n are integers with n â‰  0.  
3. Now, we square both sides, so x^2 = (m/n)^2.  
4. This gives us x^2 = m^2/n^2, where m^2 and n^2 are integers.  
5. From the definition of a rational number, x^2 is rational.  
6. This completes the proof step via contraposition.

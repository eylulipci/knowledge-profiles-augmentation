- Assuming the contraposition.
  1) Let’s consider that not q is the case where x is rational.
  2) x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
  3) Then, x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.
  4) Therefore, x^2 is rational because p^2 and q^2 are integers and q^2 ≠ 0.
  5) The goal of contraposition is to find that  if x^2 is irrational.

- 1. CONTRAPOSITION
  We assume x is rational.
  We write x as a/b, where a and b are integers, b ≠ 0, with no common factors.
  Squaring both sides, x^2 becomes (a POWER 2) / (b^2).
  Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a rational number.
  ∴ If x^2 is irrational, x would be irrational. However, I did not explicitly state it.

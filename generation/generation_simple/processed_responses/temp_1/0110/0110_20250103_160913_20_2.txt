1. Assume first that x is a rational number, so we can write x = m/n where m and n are integers with n â‰  0. [Assumption]
2. It follows that x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2, which is the form of a rational number. [Proof step]
3. Thus, x^2 is rational based on the definition of a rational number. [Conclusion]
4. With this idea, x being rational implies that x^2 is rational.

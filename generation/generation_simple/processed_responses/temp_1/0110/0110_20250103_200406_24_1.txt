Student Answer 1:  
"Prove by contraposition.

1) Assume x is a rational number.  
2) Then x = p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0.  
3) x^2 = (p/q)^2 = (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2).  
4) (p POWER 2)/(q POWER 2) is also a rational number.  
5) This shows that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational."

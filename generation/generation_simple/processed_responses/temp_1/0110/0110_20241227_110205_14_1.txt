1. Consider the assumption for a proof by contraposition and suppose x is a rational number.
2. Let x be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors, and b â‰  0.
3. Then, x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2 = a^2/b^2, implying x^2 is a rational number since it is the quotient of two integers.
4. From this, we deduce that when x is rational, x^2 is also rational.
5. However, we have not shown that if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.

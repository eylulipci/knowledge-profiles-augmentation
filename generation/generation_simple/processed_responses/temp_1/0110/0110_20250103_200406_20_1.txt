- By contraposition, we consider that if x is rational, then x^2 must also be rational.  
1) Assume x is rational.  
2) We can write x as a/b where a and b are integers, and b â‰  0, with no common factors.  
3) Squaring both sides gives us x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is a ratio of integers.  
5) Thus, x^2 is rational.

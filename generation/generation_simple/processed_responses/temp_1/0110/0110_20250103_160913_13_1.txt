1. Intended proof
  Reasoning to be accomplished using contraposition:

2. Begin assumption: Let's assume x is rational.
   Translate x to a=b where a and b are integers, and b is not equal to 0.

3. Calculation: Therefore, (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2) results in x^2.

4. Determine status: h as integers suggest x^2 is rational. Rationality implies the quotient.

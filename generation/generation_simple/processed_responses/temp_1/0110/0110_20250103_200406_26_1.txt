1. CONTRAPOSITION  
1) Assume that x is rational.  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0.  
3) Squaring both sides, x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) Since the quotient a^2/b^2 is a rational number, x^2 is rational.  
5) Therefore, if x^2 is irrational, then x is not likely rational.

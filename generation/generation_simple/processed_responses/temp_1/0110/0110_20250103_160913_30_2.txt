- Start with the contraposition.
  1) First, assume that x is rational.
  2) Thus, x can be expressed as x = m/n, with m and n integers, n ≠ 0.
  3) If we square x, we get x^2 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2.
  4) Since m^2 and n^2 are integers and n^2 ≠ 0, x^2 is rational.
  5) The converse points to finding if x^2 is irrational.

1. Start by assuming x is rational.
2. Then x = a/b for some integers a and b, with b â‰  0 and a and b having no common factors.
3. Now, consider x^2 = (a/b) POWER 2, which is a^2/b^2.
4. Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is rational.
5. Therefore, by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, then x cannot be rational.

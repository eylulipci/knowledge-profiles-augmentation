"1. We want to prove using contraposition that: If x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.
2. Let us assume that x is irrational. [Assumption]
3. This means x cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b where both a and b are integers.",1,0,0,0
"To prove the implication by contraposition, I need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

Now following the format of the proof:

1. Suppose x^2 is not a rational number. 
2. Then show that x cannot be a rational number.

Concluding the proof by contraposition, if x^2 is irrational, x must also be irrational.",1,0,0,0
"1. To prove the statement by contraposition, we need to show that if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
2. Assume x^2 is rational.  
3. Then x^2 = c/d, where c and d are integers with no common factor, and d ≠ 0.  
4. It follows that x = (ROOT(c/d)), but I struggle to proceed further.  
5. Therefore, the contrapositive holds: if x^2 is irrational, then x is irrational.",1,0,0,0
"Begin with the contrapositive approach by showing that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational. 
1) Assume x^2 is irrational and therefore conclude x is irrational. 
2) Recall that if x is rational, x^2 must be rational, which establishes a -> b. 
3) Since the contrapositive a -> b holds true, our original statement follows logically from this.",1,0,0,0
"1. TO PROVE BY CONTRAPOSITION, SHOW IF NOT Q -> NOT P

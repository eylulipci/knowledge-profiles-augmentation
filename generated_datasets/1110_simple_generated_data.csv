We need to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1) Suppose x is rational.  
2) By definition, x = a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
3) Squaring gives x^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2/b^2.  
4) a^2 and b^2 remain integers, so x^2 is rational.

"Let's prove the statement using contraposition: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.

1) Assume x is a rational number. [Assumption]

2) Thus, x can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. [Definition of rational number]

3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).

4) Since a^2 and b^2 are integers, x^2 is expressed as a ratio of two integers. [Definition of rational number]

5) Therefore, x^2 is rational.",1,1,1,0
"- 1. CONTRAPOSITION  
We need to prove that if x is rational, then x^2 is also rational.  
1) Assume x is rational. [Premise]  
2) Then x can be expressed as a/b where a and b are integers and b≠0. [Definition of rational number]  
3) Then x^2 = (a/b)² = a²/b². [Squaring]  
4) Since a and b are integers, a² and b² are also integers, and b²≠0. [Integer properties]  
5) Thus, x^2 = a²/b² is a rational number. [Definition of rational number]",1,1,1,0

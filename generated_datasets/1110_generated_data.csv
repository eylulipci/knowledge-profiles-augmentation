"1. CONTRAPOSITION
  
1) We have to prove: if x is rational, then x^2 is rational.
2) Let x be a rational number; thus, x = a/b for integers a, b with b ≠ 0 [Assumed]
3) Squaring gives us: x^2 = (a POWER 2)/(b POWER 2)
4) Define c = a^2 and d = b^2 for another pair of integers c, d [New variables]
5) x^2 can be expressed as c/d, showing x^2 is rational [Rational conclusion]",1,1,1,0
"1. CONTRAPOSITION  
Show that if x is rational, x^2 must be rational:  
1) x is rational (Assumption)  
2) Thus, x can be written as p/q, with no common factors in the form.  
3) Squaring both sides gives x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2.  
4) This allows x^2 to be rational.",1,1,1,0
"1) CONTRAPOSITION  
To show: If x is rational, then x^2 is rational.  
1. Assume x is rational.  
2. Then x can be expressed as x = a/b, where a and b are integers.  
3. Squaring both sides, we have x^2 = (a^2)/(b^2).  
4. Thus, x^2 is rational because it is a ratio of two integers.",1,1,1,0
